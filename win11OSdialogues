## Windows OS Dialogues

1. This is confusing as the website talked about biometrics/screenlock... but the OS presented a window that asked me for my pin. The website could instead say something like "You can use your compatible smartphone, Windows Hello, iCloud Keychain"...
  - Suggestions: A little weird that under more choices that Pin is still an option. The sentence will likely be skipped over by users... emphasize the important information (website/email/app asking for the passkey)
2. Good design for the most part... except the previous comment about default option being twice.
  - Suggestions: Remove the big "moto g play - 2023" from the top (it shows the user's current selection, but the current selection is also highlighted... still should remove). Make all 4 options the same size. This should be the default screen. Then give the user the option after choosing a method to make that method their default (e.g., This Windows Device... then always offer screen from Step 2.)... this gives the user more control and also doesn't tempt the user into a mistake on a public device or a device they may not own.
3. Seems fine... same comments as 1. about making the important information emphasized.
4. No issues... I do like that tells the user there is a connection between the desktop and mobile device.
5. The emphasis when using windows hello on this screen is what we should see on ALL dialog screens. When using an iPhone/iPad/Android... Windows only knows it is another device... I like the privacy here...
