# Uber

- a short dialog after "Create a Passkey"
- see screenshot in Discord
  - Passkeys are easier and more secure than passwords
  - With Passkeys, you can login to Uber with:
    - Face ID
    - Touch ID
    - Passcode
- Once you click "Create a Passkey" the OS dialog comes up, and then you're done
- no option to name them -- they are named where they are stored
