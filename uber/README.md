# Uber

## Windows Walkthrough
| Step | Success and Failure | Design Suggestions or Comments |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
|Step 0. Account Security Page. | Display's an arrow next to passkeys. <br> "Passkeys are easier and more secure than passwords." | Same thing as most companies... | 
|Step 1. Click in the passkeys field | Popup window that gives a little bit more information. | Bad info... You can log in to Uber with: Face ID, Touch ID, Passcode... my device biometrics are being used to login. | 
|Step 2. Click "Create a Passkey" | See (Win 11 OS)[win11OSdialogues.md] | forces you to use the local device. Which makes the bad info from Step 1 worse... because it only talked about smart phone device authentication methods. | 
|Step 3. Click "OK" at the OS dialoge... go to Passkeys page. | Displays "CHrome on Windows", date created and last used. | The passkey was used on Chrome, created in Windows... not in Chrome on Windows... weird phrasing that could be confusing. | 

## Notes for Mac
1. If I cancel out of OS dialogue, then you get another option -- Chrome profile --
  and no option for security keys or phone
