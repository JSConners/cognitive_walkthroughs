1dezmbw,Amazon passkey and Windows 10 vs Windows 11,"I'm assuming I just don't understand enough about how passkeys work but I ran into a thing I don't understand. I wanted to setup my Amazon account for a passkey. I have a Windows 11 laptop with Windows Hello. It's a Surface Laptop 5 so I'm using facial recognition, and also have a PIN setup behind that. I have previously setup passkeys on this, using Windows Hello, for sites like Github, Google, Home Depot and a couple other sites that probably don't need passkeys but I set them up because they were available and I'm trying to learn how this tech works.

Anyway, I went to Amazon account settings and selected to setup a passkey and am presented with [these options](https://i.imgur.com/53zrTT7.png). I didn't really have time to mess with it but wanted Windows Hello as an option so I just left it for the time being. Later in the day I was on a different PC with Windows 10. Windows Hello is setup on this computer but only with a PIN as there are no biometric options available. Just as a curiosity, and because I also have some passkeys setup here, I tried setting up the Amazon passkey again and was presented with [these options](https://i.imgur.com/28fYEd6.png).

I tried changing a couple settings here and there on my Win11 PC but nothing has given me the Windows Hello option. What am I doing wrong that I can't get the Amazon key to work like I have with a handful of other keys on this machine?

edit:  I should have tried it on Win10 to see what happened. I just tried it on my Win10 machine and here is what happened when I selected the option for Windows Hello:

It's hard to say, but based on how it worked in Windows 10, it might be a bug.Comment 6: Have you tried clicking more choices?Comment 7: [deleted]Comment 8: Damn. well not much you can do at this point, but to create the passkey on your phone. Personally, I like it this way cause then you can sign in on pretty much any device with QR code. You can always create another passkey on your Windows 11 when they have it enabled or fixed."

1d6yonb,Passkey security analysis,"Hello, I'm doing some preliminary research on this topic because I've been seeing so much content on youtube and social media about the wonders of passkey and how it's going to be the end of passwords. I would like to invite anyone with deep technical knowledge to discuss with me to see if there is any merit to my arguments.

  
1. Passkeys are just SSH keys to websites. If not secured properly, they can be stolen/abused because there is so much trust in the private key.

2. The server does not care where the client's private key is stored, all it cares about is a signed challenge that can be verified by the client's public key.

3. Common client side storage solutions involve password managers, browsers (stored inside chrome/ff) - these reside on the filesystem, and can be copied either knowingly or unknowingly. If stored in TPM, or some other hardware enclave, then it more or less considered secure, but is lost in the event of physical loss/theft. 

4. iCloud stores the passkeys encrypted and decrypted in the \[embedded secure enclave for M-series/T2 for Intel\], but are synced to any device to which the gatekeeper is ... \[drumroll\] ... your Apple ID (username/password).

My argument is the storage and protection of the client's ability to protect the private key is paramount and the risk has not been reduced from using passwords but only shifted at the cost of phishing resistance.

I imagine there is also a trilemma here (I derived this idea upon the Bitcoin trilemma): Security, Simplicity, Recoverability -- pick 2. 

  - Passkeys are Secure and Simple, but difficult to Recover (or maybe easy to recover if you're an attacker). 

  - Passwords are Simple and Recoverable, but not Secure.

  - This leaves something that is Recoverable and Secure, but not Simple. I'm not sure what this solution would be. Maybe user education? (lol).

Thx for reading  
",fuzzy8balls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1d6yonb/passkey_security_analysis/,,,"Comment 1: I agree with your analysis, with some nuances...

1. Yes indeed. If the key is stolen, it grants access.
2. Yes and no. The service \*can\* decide to reject multi-device passkeys for instance, or just allow a subset of hardware security keys... but it can only reject it after the public key credential was created, when receiving it, which leads to a very poor user experience. A request to the RFC to add such a filter was rejected so far.
3. Yes, convinience vs security. A service allowing to register multiple passkeys per account would solve the recovery issue.
4. Well, multi-device passkeys are stored locally, remotely and are in-transit over the wire. Although they go great length to protect all that, it is still more exposed to risk. Hardware-bound keys, as far as I know, have their key never exposed, they just sign the payloads.

That's my take on it.

Although it protects from phishing and password reuse, it is a \*lot\* of complexity. And the evolution from hardware-bound passkeys to multi-device passkeys transformed the whole from ""secure by design"" to ""trust us with your keys"". It sacrified security/privacy for convinience.Comment 2: I would agree with your assessment.

Passkeys are so not SSH keys.  SSH and Passkeys are both PKI-based credentials.  They both rely on the same base technologies.

But you are right they could be stolen if you can get into the store.   It's why their storage has to be well secured and the actual passkey data hard to get to.  To pick a trustworthy storage provider.

2.  
The server can care, it depends on the setup.  The server could fingerprint that it's the same machine each time and do additional prompts on a new machine.  No one is requiring a passkey to be the final source of authentication.  Passkey + rotating code is an option.

3.  
This is true.  So you should be picking your passkey storage based on trust of the platform.

4. You are correct but it's encrypted on sync and the key relies on knowing your device pin.  You also can go further secure your account with a fido key so someone can't add your account without having it.   So being able to access passkeys is tied to a second factor only you should know or have, so you're involved in sync setup.  And better than passwords, only those specific devices have access to the passkey.   You also should have face id turned on so someone can't get into your device to use them.

That's the fundamental summary of passkeys, if you don't have two factors in place the security is far lower.  My desktop setup doesn't let me use them without entering my 1password password but I also can set it to not ask for the password for so many hours if I choose to.  I'm in charge with the security level I get on device.  I can make it prompt immediately if I want.

If someone gets into my machine in that period they can use my passkeys but they're better than passwords because they have to get onto my machine to use them.   I have my password keeper secured in a way they have to be with me to set it up on a new device and I can revoke access to the keeper on the device when I want. With iCloud you can remove from/block the account from a specific device remotely if you need to.

So to your final line I would say that recovery needing be simple ties to utilizing the recovery methods platforms build in.   Like with iCloud you can print out a recovery code on paper to get into your account.  With 1password they have you print out the same to get into your account.  I have four pieces of paper in our home fire safe.

For me I have a bunch of key accounts secured with physical keys,  my 1password  account included, and my third one always stays at home in a fire safe or a safe deposit box at home or in the bank.  I have a few more accounts to add to it but once it's done I can get into key accounts with it and it's not something that can be hacked.

Either option works, printing is cheaper.  But what it is in a break glass method of access.  That's what we need everyone to implement.

My rotating keys are synced with my google account which is secured with two factor, my physical security key one of them.  One could print out access codes, not as good but perfectly usable.  So same idea, if I need a two factor key I can open my safe and get into my account.

It's layers of security and emergency access handled so I can't be fully locked out and others will have a hard time getting in equally.Comment 3: I posted a question here a while back that had basically the same premise as yours. What I gathered is that yes, your 4 points are basically correct. Passkeys are more complicated than passwords, and therefore more secure in that sense, but the system does not really improve upon the security issues present if one of your devices becomes rooted/compromised. They are better at preventing phishing than passwords are, and they are better at stalling brute-force/dictionary attacks, but they don’t really prevent copying issues on compromised devices.Comment 4: Thanks. I'd like to ask you more on multi-device vs device bound passkeys. How can a service know what you have? Public/Private keypairs are either Elliptic Curve or RSA which are usually 256-bit or 2048-bit, respectively which is doesn't contain data on how it's stored. The metadata on multidevice vs device bound would have to exist outside of the key and the service would basically have to trust that the client is creating a ""device bound"" key.

For example, I could tell the service ""yes I'm creating a device bound passkey"" and then create the keypair in bitwarden instead of my TPM. What prevents me from doing that?Comment 5: they’re less complicated when you understand them.

just that the learning curve is longerComment 6: During creation of the public key credential, there are some bit flags set on the authenticator data (see [Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials - Level 3 (w3c.github.io)](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-attestation)) . The third bit flag called ""[Backup Eligibility](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#backup-eligibility)"" means in practice it's synced / multi-device. Check out the demo here [webauthn.passwordless.id/demos/basic.html](https://webauthn.passwordless.id/demos/basic.html) to see if yours is synced or not. Now, it's possible that the authenticator sends any bit flags there, and actually most password managers lie about the user verification flag (see [Known Issues | passkeys.dev](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/known-issues/)). If you want to really be sure, you have to verify the attestation of the device to ensure it was certified and such ...but (A) it might be anonymized by the browser, it (B) might not be send at all (thanks apple) and (C) it is super complex because you must support a whole set of different freaky complex signature chain verification stuff. So usually, you just trust that what you are given during registration is true and take the flags as an indication of whether it's hardware-bound or ""backed up"" (in the cloud and synced on your other devices).Comment 7: Ok, seems like this feature is not quite mature yet but the architecture relies on trust that the client is truthful and that is not highly assuring. Thank you dagnelies.Comment 8: The relying party has full control over the passkey registration/attestation process. If browsers anonymize the registration process or if the platform, client, or device (such as iCloud Keychain) does not support attestation, the relying party can always choose to drop the registration process. This means the RP would only support MDS-known authenticators, which are primarily hardware-bound keys.

For C, server libraries already exist, such as those from Yubico.Comment 9: Most websites typically allow any authenticator, they do not desire to restrict the user to specific hardware security keys. As such, there is usually no real need to prove the device model, it's more for informational purposes and tampering is of little interest.

  
It's the authentication that is important, and this one always contains a signed payload including the challenge, which is just another terminology for a nonce.Comment 10: Do you have any documentation on how this is implemented? It looks like to me MDS is a CA run by FIDO and signs the various authenticator vendors (yubikey, thales, ledger, etc.). Does this mean that the actual hardware module has a private key with a certificate that is signed by that CA and can cross sign whatever challenges that the passkey signs to also provide an attestation that it definitely came from within a hardware bound authenticator?","Hello, I'm doing some preliminary research on this topic because I've been seeing so much content on youtube and social media about the wonders of passkey and how it's going to be the end of passwords.

just that the learning curve is longerComment 6: During creation of the public key credential, there are some bit flags set on the authenticator data (see [Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials - Level 3 (w3c.github.io)](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-attestation)) . The third bit flag called ""[Backup Eligibility](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#backup-eligibility)"" means in practice it's synced / multi-device. Check out the demo here [webauthn.passwordless.id/demos/basic.html](https://webauthn.passwordless.id/demos/basic.html) to see if yours is synced or not. Now, it's possible that the authenticator sends any bit flags there, and actually most password managers lie about the user verification flag (see [Known Issues | passkeys.dev](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/known-issues/)). If you want to really be sure, you have to verify the attestation of the device to ensure it was certified and such ...but (A) it might be anonymized by the browser, it (B) might not be send at all (thanks apple) and (C) it is super complex because you must support a whole set of different freaky complex signature chain verification stuff. So usually, you just trust that what you are given during registration is true and take the flags as an indication of whether it's hardware-bound or ""backed up"" (in the cloud and synced on your other devices).Comment 7: Ok, seems like this feature is not quite mature yet but the architecture relies on trust that the client is truthful and that is not highly assuring. Thank you dagnelies.Comment 8: The relying party has full control over the passkey registration/attestation process. If browsers anonymize the registration process or if the platform, client, or device (such as iCloud Keychain) does not support attestation, the relying party can always choose to drop the registration process. This means the RP would only support MDS-known authenticators, which are primarily hardware-bound keys.

For C, server libraries already exist, such as those from Yubico.Comment 9: Most websites typically allow any authenticator, they do not desire to restrict the user to specific hardware security keys. As such, there is usually no real need to prove the device model, it's more for informational purposes and tampering is of little interest.

  
It's the authentication that is important, and this one always contains a signed payload including the challenge, which is just another terminology for a nonce.Comment 10: Do you have any documentation on how this is implemented? It looks like to me MDS is a CA run by FIDO and signs the various authenticator vendors (yubikey, thales, ledger, etc.). Does this mean that the actual hardware module has a private key with a certificate that is signed by that CA and can cross sign whatever challenges that the passkey signs to also provide an attestation that it definitely came from within a hardware bound authenticator?"
1d6s0t1,Issue with signing into Google account on desktop using my Samsung Galaxy s24+ passkey. ,"Greetings! 


I was wondering has anyone had an issue were they used to be able to use their phone as the passkey to sign into their Google account on their desktop but now they can't do it using their Galaxy s24 or Galaxy phone? 


A little back story: I used to be able to use my Pixel phone as a passkey whenever I would log in to Google on my desktop. There was a little issue with at first but once I got the issue worked out it was smooth sailing. But then I got this year a Samsung Galaxy s24+ and most recently whenever I try to log into my Google account on the desktop and use my phone as a passkey it doesn't work. Google just give me the error "" we weren't able to sign you in. Try again or try another way."" Then after I do get in using my old password and I try to create another or new passkey then I get this error under the create a passkey part: ""let's save a passkey on this device to sign in to ""google.com"" as my personal@gmail.com. this request comes from the app ""brave.exe"" by Brave software inc."" then it's prompting me for a pin but I don't have a pin for brave browser on my desktop. And I don't want to save a passkey to my PC. I want to use my phone as a passkey to sign into my Google account. 

Then whenever I select the other option ""use another device"" under the create a passkey it wants me to ""insert your security key into the USB port"" which I don't have. I just want to set up a new passkey for my Galaxy s24+ phone so I can use it to sign into my Google account on my desktop. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

1d4kfm8,Will the experience with 1password and passkey be improved?,"For normal password, TOTP, and SMS authentication, I could log in by copying a certain number of characters from 1password and typing them in anyway, even if the platform I am trying to log in on is a browser in Incognito mode.

I mean if I can sign in with just my passkeys then cool but I should be able to just remove auth right.

maybe I'll have to completely disable 2fa and password less to be able to remove authenticator.Comment 26: I use bitwarden and set up aegis for totp. despite having passkeys set up, and my preferred authenticator (aegis and on iPhone ente), still can't remove ms authenticator.Comment 27: As I said before, I didn't test the Remove feature because I use Authenticator to sync passwords between my iPhone and my PC.  My advice is to remain passwordless with Yubikeys and just leave Authenticator installed.  The only time you would have to use it is if MS sent you a notification to sign-in.  You certainly don't want to uninstall it if there's a chance they might send a notification.

In addition to Yubikeys and a Windows Hello Passkey, I also have an alternate email in that list, do you?  Maybe that is required before they will let you remove Authenticator.

PS:  Authenticator makes it easy to check your sign-in activity.  Possibly another reason to keep it installed.  I'm a big fan of passwordless accounts and if MS requires Authenticator to enable passwordless, I'm more than willing keep it installed.Comment 28: yeah I'm on the same page, I like having a pw-less MS account and I used to use auth to view login attempts. it would just be nice to be able to restrict my login options to passkeys.

If you don't see ""Send sign-in notification"" in the list, then it has already been removed and you should still be able to safely uninstall Authenticator.Comment 24: In your case, because you are cross-platform, iOS/Android, you should stick with a third-party password manager like MS Authenticator or any other that supports passkeys.Comment 25: I did exactly that. auth is listed among other ways to prove who I am, my usual authenticator, my passkeys etc, but when I click remove it says unable to without further explanation. 

I mean if I can sign in with just my passkeys then cool but I should be able to just remove auth right.

maybe I'll have to completely disable 2fa and password less to be able to remove authenticator.Comment 26: I use bitwarden and set up aegis for totp. despite having passkeys set up, and my preferred authenticator (aegis and on iPhone ente), still can't remove ms authenticator.Comment 27: As I said before, I didn't test the Remove feature because I use Authenticator to sync passwords between my iPhone and my PC.  My advice is to remain passwordless with Yubikeys and just leave Authenticator installed.  The only time you would have to use it is if MS sent you a notification to sign-in.  You certainly don't want to uninstall it if there's a chance they might send a notification.

In addition to Yubikeys and a Windows Hello Passkey, I also have an alternate email in that list, do you?  Maybe that is required before they will let you remove Authenticator.

PS:  Authenticator makes it easy to check your sign-in activity.  Possibly another reason to keep it installed.  I'm a big fan of passwordless accounts and if MS requires Authenticator to enable passwordless, I'm more than willing keep it installed.Comment 28: yeah I'm on the same page, I like having a pw-less MS account and I used to use auth to view login attempts. it would just be nice to be able to restrict my login options to passkeys. I don't really use it for anything except a one drive account and retrieving old emails (I switched to proton last year but have tons of ms emails I still need access to). thanks for the tips:)"

I set it up on my computer and can login just fine from there but no mater what I do, I cannot login through my app. Does anyone know how to fix this?

Windows makes device bound passkeys that stay on the device. macOS makes syncable passkeys that are available on other apple devices. 

If you want to use a passkey on android you should make it there. Other android devices you logon to using the same Google account will then have access to the same passkeys. And these android passkeys can be used on windows or macOS via a qr code scan based flow.Comment 2: me the Samsung pass passkey will come up and then say no passkeys found when I try to use them on some sites. s24ultra android 14. no idea why.Comment 3: I use Dashlane, so I can use the same passkeys on my Android phone, iPad and on desktop, Windows and Linux.

I'm trying to test passkey on [passkeys.io](http://passkeys.io) - passkey is saved on RP side, but not on my device. 

My phone is synced to my google account. No idea what I'm doing wrong. 

I know I can use some 3rd party passkey provider, but I want to test the platform authenticator on Android.Comment 6: I use windows 10.

It wont let me create a passkey for android. On the Passkeys section of Gmail it says that Android devices automatically create passkeys for me. But when the time comes to login with a passkey, it doesnt create one for me.Comment 7: theres no way for me to setup passkey on Samsung pass. Im on Android 13Comment 8: [deleted]Comment 9: It sounds to me as though you are under the mistaken belief that your Android phone will automatically create a passkey for every third party account and an app when you log into them, similar to how a password manager or browser may ask you if you wish for it to save login credentials after you have signed into a site. That's not how it works for passkeys. Not every site or service supports passkeys, and for those that do, you usually have to go to your account settings after logging in and choosing to create a passkey, similar to registering a security key por authenticator app for 2FA. Some sites may ask you if you want to create a passkey after you have signed in, but that's up to the site, and it's rare.

Since you mentioned Coinbase, for example, after you log into coinbase on your phone you'd go to the security settings page and select the 2FA settings tab. Under the Available Methods section, select Passkey, then Add Passkey. Follow the prompts. Sometimes a service will only allow you to create a passkey through their website, not their app, so you may have to use your phone's browser. There is a way to save a passkey onto your phone from another device, such as a Windows PC, but I won't get into that here.

When Google says that it automatically creates a passkey on your Android phone, it was talking specifically about a passkey to log into Google and Google services, such as Gmail. You can test this by opening incognito session on your mobile web browser. Go to Gmail.com. when you get the screen where it asks for your password, instead of entering your password, click on the link below it that says""try another way"". Select the option for a passkey, and it will use the Google passkey that was already created on the phone to log you in to gmail, without having to enter your password or 2FA credentials.Comment 10: you can save and use them with chrome tho right?Comment 11: Passkey is not supported on Android 13. You will need Android 14+Comment 12: I've not tried with any cryptocurrency exchanges yet as I'm not currently using them, but I have had that problem with one or two other sites. Sometimes it does still appear in Dashlane after an apparent error. It seems that not all sites have got it working perfectly with every platform yet.

It might be worth making Dashlane aware of this.Comment 13: Thanks for the response. The issue for Coinbase is that I turned on passkey yesterday on my computer ( I didnt know what it was until then ) and after I did that it started asking for my passkey immediately on my Android. I cant log in from my Android anymore because I never set up a passkey on my Android yet it keeps asking for one. 

I would turn it off but unfortunately the Security tab to turn it off always 404s for me so I have no way to turn it off. By what you wrote, Coinbase should have allowed me to log into the app from the Android and then asked me to set up a passkey but it never did that, it just asked me to enter one straight away after I set it up on my computer.Comment 14: Not on what I want to use it on, which is Coinbase. It just simply says No passkeys available on both the web browser and the app.Comment 15: If Coinbase were to let you log in on your phone with just the username and password, it would entirely defeat the purpose of having enabled 2FA. The whole point of 2FA is to require something other than a password to log in, in case your password gets compromised. If it would have let you log in with just the password, that means another person who stole your password could just as easily have logged in and then locked you.

I think the problem is that you created a single device-bound passkey on your PC. You should be able to log back into Coinbase using that PC, because it holds the passkey. Then, you can go to your account settings and fix this problem in a number of different ways.Comment 16: Did you setup the passkey in a synced  account on Windows that you can access on Android, in a supported Android release?

passkeys are device bound unless you did that step and bound it to a password keeper that can present them through OS integration 

1password comes to mindComment 17: That's probably because you did not save a passkey to your Android phone; you only saved a single-device passkey onto your PC. What you need to do is the following.  On the computer where you created the passkey use the Google Chrome browser to log into the Coinbase website. You should be able to log in since that PC has the passkey. Navigate through the account settings / Security settings until you find the option to add a passkey, and select it. When the prompt pops up select the option that's called ""a different device"" or  ""Try another way"" until you see a QR code to scan with your phone. That will create a passkey on your phone that will sync through your Google account.
After you scan the QR code, you can choose to remember your computer. If you do, the computer shows your Android device as an option when you need a passkey. When you select it, you receive a notification on your device to verify your identity.Comment 18: I would turn off passkey if I could on the app, the issue is the Security tab doesnt work it just 404s on my computer. So the only way for me to allow any change to the passkey is broken so Im just completely stuck.","Whenever I try to login to an App (specifically Coinbase) it gives me the error ""No passkeys available"".

If it allows additional passkeys you can try the flow and see if it lets you scan a qr code to do the hybrid flow where credential lives on the phone. At this point you can login using passkey on PC and passkey on the phone.

Then when it comes to accessing the same site/app on your phone if they allow using a passkey you can use the one provisioned earlier on the phone.

You can test this process using https://passkeys.io to get an idea of what I mean.Comment 2: Oh my god you saved me! I had been trying to set up a passkey on my google account instead and it kept failing, I hadn't even thought of setting one up on onelogin

The FAQ does not make all this clear
Seems there are passkeys for android which are backed up and doesn't make clear if you can recover with legacy login if you lose you phone but dies say they are backed up. So is this just to enable fingerprint for Google websites in just android. Want to make sure can also log into Google if phone list

It also says window 11 has passkeys with windows hello but there are not backed up this implies that you don't need passkeys to login to Google if you list you phone and passkeys are not used from phone to log in in a PC

It would help if you would specify whether you're using a phone or PC. Sometimes you say W11 but sometimes you don't. I assume those times are on an Android.

Google released passkeys a while ago and it seemed quite broken at the time. It seems better now but still has some problems.

Right now, I can use passkeys to login on an iphone with an iphone.

I also logged in on an Android by scanning a QR code on the Android with my iphone  which provided the pk to Android.

I can not create a PK on a Pixel 4 even though it has a button to do so. The button just doesn't work.

I can create a PK on a USB FIDO2 key and use it on Windows 7/chrome.

As for your Q about backups, I already said you can generate backup codes. You can also enroll an authenticator. I have tried both of those. Most backup methods require another phone or a USB device. If you don't have either, then the backup code is your only option.

1caxek4,whats the (future) point of passkeys?,"on a phone/tablet (both samsung in my case, and an iphone) are the options to how u create/save passkeys limited to the browser ur using (so chrome pw manager) and on device (samsung pass and keychain)? i know u can save to other pw managers that are pk capable but i baaically only use bitwarden.

my actual question i realize is - i cant save pk to bitwarden unless im using the extension on desktop, yes? my desktop is old windows 10 and out of comission atm, but if i save pk via extension in bw i assume i can use them across all devices thereafter, amirite? or no. 

is the point of pk that u will have to use it as part of logging in in the future rather than it actually replacing passwords? i think i read a bw article kind of saying that but also read that google is gonna allow passwordless w passkey login soonish, kinda like microsoft i guess. i like the latters combo of pw-less and passkey, but wonder why i cant delete my email and number (must be replaced with alternatives first when i try). im guessing theres also a good reason why their own authenticator ""must"" be used for it too (idk what tho). i use another totp elsewhere - why does ms force it on u even if u set up ur own totp authenticator? (mines ente).

meandering, sorry! just trying to understand some basics here, thanks! ",dxg168,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1caxek4/whats_the_future_point_of_passkeys/,,,"Comment 1: Bitwarden supports Passkeys only using the browser extension and in the latest iOS client beta, but it's only a matter of time until it's supported more broadly on all platforms. It's all still very new.

So far most websites only implement passkeys as 2FA method and still require a traditional username/password combo to login, as you noted some are going passwordless. With passkeys you don't even require a username, but I haven't seen any bigger website implement it that way so far.

Because it’s embedded in the passkey. Comment 4: thanks, it seems like w the advent of passkeys it would make sense to begin eliminating less secure forms of 2fa, since pk are more or less used as a form of 2fa with most accounts theyre available on. that part makes it seem like pk would have already proven one purpose (to get rid of less secure 2fa), but that hasnt really happened, seems to me anyway.

why force me to keep a numher for verification purposes (as well as an email) when a pk is avaulable to use in its place?

amazon doesnt require a phone number, but it does still req an email and password + totp. ms, no pw anymore but must keep  email and or a phone number, and i dont think u can choose pk to login w. is this just cuz each company chooses to implement them differently? they shouldnt be wary of letting users who want it have the option to only use pk as login or as 2fa (and bye to sms for ex). i get that its new and costly to imppement tho hence mixed bags re implelementation.Comment 5: thanks! u mean like if u lose ur device or accidentally delete the needed passkey? i get that. i guess im just wondering why companies like microsoft force me to retain an email plus number or 2 different emails for verification. passkeys and the other 2fa set up are better than email options and are more secure, right? like if my.pk was the only way for me to verify, itd eliminate the risk of the other methods still being used against me to gain access to the account in question (in this case, outlook, which ive.got set up passwordless, a totp app, and have several passkeys, but cant delete either of the 2 emails they require me to keep for verification.

with all the other methods of 2fa set up isnt it not a bad idea to allow opting out of email 2fa? already got authenticator, passkey, totp, i just use email 2fa when ms decides it doesnt like the way i used their authenticator and starts glitching during login lol. this started being a thing after i changed mine to an alias and removed my original addy and man does authenticator not like that. 

any idea ms requires their authenticator for pw-less, even as it allows other auth apps? is it a get everybody to use authenticator thing or is it just more manageable keeping that in house with the move to pw-less? my outlook is the sole reason i have ms auth on my phone.","on a phone/tablet (both samsung in my case, and an iphone) are the options to how u create/save passkeys limited to the browser ur using (so chrome pw manager) and on device (samsung pass and keychain)? i know u can save to other pw managers that are pk capable but i baaically only use bitwarden.

my actual question i realize is - i cant save pk to bitwarden unless im using the extension on desktop, yes? my desktop is old windows 10 and out of comission atm, but if i save pk via extension in bw i assume i can use them across all devices thereafter, amirite? or no. 

is the point of pk that u will have to use it as part of logging in in the future rather than it actually replacing passwords? i think i read a bw article kind of saying that but also read that google is gonna allow passwordless w passkey login soonish, kinda like microsoft i guess. i like the latters combo of pw-less and passkey, but wonder why i cant delete my email and number (must be replaced with alternatives first when i try). im guessing theres also a good reason why their own authenticator ""must"" be used for it too (idk what tho). i use another totp elsewhere - why does ms force it on u even if u set up ur own totp authenticator? (mines ente).

meandering, sorry! just trying to understand some basics here, thanks! Comment 1: Bitwarden supports Passkeys only using the browser extension and in the latest iOS client beta, but it's only a matter of time until it's supported more broadly on all platforms. It's all still very new.

So far most websites only implement passkeys as 2FA method and still require a traditional username/password combo to login, as you noted some are going passwordless. With passkeys you don't even require a username, but I haven't seen any bigger website implement it that way so far. I don't see why that wouldn't be changed in the future, though.Comment 2: Pass keys can already replace passwords completely.

1c2x2ln,Keycloak and Passkeys,"Hi Everyone,

Dropping a blog I wrote detailing how I use keycloak to implement passkeys for webapps. Hoping it helps a poor soul some day in the future.

One note for anyone else setting up keycloak with podman, I was not able to get it to launch the admin console in Chrome when the service was front-ended with nginx to add SSL, without adding `-e KC_PROXY=edge` to the podman command. Otherwise it gets the ""refused to load mixed content"" error in the browser console.Comment 2: Thanks for the feedback. The keycloak documentation is known to be a bit clunky. Make sure you are looking at current quarkus documentation. https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-config. The container equivalent ENV Vars to set for each option are noted in the bottom left of the config option description ie.  'Env: KC_CACHE'.

There are a handful of things recommended to hit when you are ready for production https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-production.   You will want to update the container COMMAND to be 'start' instead of 'start-dev' to enable production optimizations. 

One annoying thing the keycloak container doesn't do by default is log user sign in event details to console output. You will want to enable debug level logs and turn on json logging for user events to be able to easily grab those generally required events from console output to send to a centralized logging platform in a real world cloud native pattern. 

Happy to talk consulting arrangements for support and implementation through PM.Comment 3: Thanks, this is also very helpful information. It's just a learning exercise for me though.

I did find one other ""gotcha"" when trying to add a Yubikey 5 as a passkey using the default policy settings. After registering the device, keycloak shows it in the list of registered passkeys for the account, but the Yubikey never actually stored the resident key data, so authentication fails when using it to log in. 

The fix is setting ""Require discoverable credential"" to ""Yes"" under `Configure->Authentication->Policies->Webauthn Passwordless Policy`. This is apparently only needed for the Yubikey (maybe other hardware keys too?), platform passkeys work out-of-the-box.

But it would be safer if keycloak would throw an error when the resident key data was not saved to the device (especially since there is a limit of 25 resident keys on a Yubikey), so people don't lock themselves out of their account.","Hi Everyone,

1bm4lbv,Chrome keeps sending passkey requests to wrong device,"Is there a way to control which device Google sends passkey login requests to?

I have two Android devices signed in to Google, ""Pixel 8"" (a phone) and ""Sm-X800"" (a tablet). I have a passkey for adobe.com stored in Google Passwords, which means that passkey in theory is available on both devices. I have almost always used the Pixel 8 for all passkeys.

When I try to log in to adobe.com on Chrome / Windows, Chrome pops up a dialog ""Use a passkey from Pixel 8 to sign in to adobe.com"". I say ""Continue"" and then it says ""A notification was sent to SM-X800"", a different device than I just agreed to use. It does this even when the tablet is switched off. I have the same problem with a GitHub passkey.

I can work around it going through the ""use a different device"" option in the desktop browser and then going through about 4 screens including Windows Hello. Eventually a passkey popup shows up on the phone and I can use it to log in on the desktop browser. But it's sure not convenient.

I am very scared to lose access to all of my account. My question is how do i import my passkeys into my new windows install?",andrei1010gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1bjf7lx/about_to_reinstall_windows_but_scared_to_lose/,,,"Comment 1: These are device bound passkeys. You can’t export them. So you will lose them if you reinstall. This is by design.

What you want is syncable passkeys such as those done by iOS and android natively. That isn’t available on windows yet.

For any accounts where you have a passkey I suggest configuring another if possible on another device so you have a backup method to logon. If this is not possible you will need to reconfigure replacement passkeys after reinstalling windows. This also assumes all accounts with passkeys are accessible via other methods . Else an account recovery process may need to be invoked potentially.Comment 2: This is one significant benefit of storing your passkeys on a security device like a YubiKey— to avoid this very issueComment 3: Gosh I hadn't thought about that problem!

At first I was creating my passkeys on my Windows computers; but I deleted all those and have recreated them using NordPass, which has very good support for passkeys. It's certainly not the only password manager that supports passkeys; in fact, I use Bitwarden too daily and it does fine. But NordPass identifies passkeys as a separate type of record which makes it very easy for me to see what's what. In any case, you might consider saving your passkeys to a password manager like NordPass or Bitwarden before re-installing Windows. (I know that 1Password also has strong support for passkeys and I believe Dashlane does too; probably others as well now.)Comment 4: I came here looking for this initial question, and I understood what I already imagined the answer to be. However, I remembered an alternative which is Bitwarden, which also records the passkeys, so if formatting the computer I will have an alternative. 

The question is more for the ""Bitwarden"" community users in here:

Will I be able to store a previously created passkey for a website in Bitwarden? Or will it ask me to create a new one and derail the one previously created/stored on my computer??

Thank you for your commentsComment 5: ok, ill try this.Comment 6: Same problem, just moved to a different device.  If you want to replace your YubiKey, it is the same effort.

This is the downside to device-bound Passkeys -- they are, well, bound to one device.Comment 7: that is why device bound passkeys always require a backup passkey or atleast have another backup recovery option added to the account.  
In one way device bound passkeys are more secure i.e its on your TPM chip and can be protected by a boot password etc before Windows boots and one can be sure your passkeys are never stored in the cloud and can't be compromised even if we argue its encrypted and more convenient if it syncs across all devices.Comment 8: Yes. I've been using a cheaper version security key to store backups.

But do you know if lastpass supports passkeys?Comment 10: You're less likely to need to change yubikeys than software on your phone or laptop, at least I amComment 11: > do you know if lastpass supports paskeys?

If I'm reading [this page](https://www.lastpass.com/features/passwordless-authentication) right, they support *passwordless login into LastPass itself* but that's not the same thing; actual support for passkeys  (to access third-party sites) seems to be coming*. I have no idea if that info is up to date.

Are you using LastPass already? If so, do make sure that your master password is super strong. But do be aware that LastPass has had some serious security problems of a kind that password managers ought never to have. There are lots of great alternatives: NordPass, Bitwarden, 1Password, Keeper, Roboform, now Proton Pass, and even KeePassXC are all great.Comment 12: Oh, kinda sad bc I'm using lastpass for everything. But is proton pass free?Comment 13: I haven't used LastPass for several years so I'm not completely up to speed. But here's my take for what it's worth.

* Somebody at LastPass really dropped the ball a year or two ago and their servers were breached. Some of the data that was released as a result of the breach (or breaches plural) was unencrypted and I think it included some personal info about users (like names and email addresses).
* But my understanding is that passwords were all encrypted. What this means is that if your *master password* (the one that gets you into LastPass) was long, strong and unique, *your passwords were probably not compromised*. The problem here is that word ""probably"".
* And given the horrible publicity (and the likely loss of a lot of customers that resulted) I would imagine that LastPass has, in the last year, tightened up its security. (The question here is, given their track record, do these folks have any idea what they're doing?)

A lot of people still use LastPass. Sounds like you're one of them. 

How do you know if your passwords were compromised? Get a trial version of 1Password, NordPass or Bitwarden and run their version of the report that searches the web to see if your data is ""out there"". I think Malwarebytes's website also has a free online page that does this. Or try \[haveIbeenpwned.com\]([https://haveIbeenpwned.com](https://haveIbeenpwned.com)).

I think nearly everybody who does NOT work for LastPass or still use LastPass thinks that you should abandon ship. Here's a good article from May 2023:

It's not THAT difficult to switch to a different password manager. I'm not a huge fan of Proton Pass's design but I'm confident that it's secure and a good password manager, and yes, it's free. But you can also get a free account with Bitwarden (with very few restrictions) or NordPass (with a number of restrictions). KeePassXC is also free, I think, and open source. I personally think even Google Passwords (the new version) would be an improvement.","I have a install of windows 11 on my laptop, which i have all of my passkeys on, but i want to reinstall windows on that laptop. I am very scared to lose access to all of my account. My question is how do i import my passkeys into my new windows install?Comment 1: These are device bound passkeys. You can’t export them. So you will lose them if you reinstall. This is by design.

What you want is syncable passkeys such as those done by iOS and android natively. That isn’t available on windows yet.

For any accounts where you have a passkey I suggest configuring another if possible on another device so you have a backup method to logon. If this is not possible you will need to reconfigure replacement passkeys after reinstalling windows. This also assumes all accounts with passkeys are accessible via other methods . Else an account recovery process may need to be invoked potentially.Comment 2: This is one significant benefit of storing your passkeys on a security device like a YubiKey— to avoid this very issueComment 3: Gosh I hadn't thought about that problem!

At first I was creating my passkeys on my Windows computers; but I deleted all those and have recreated them using NordPass, which has very good support for passkeys. It's certainly not the only password manager that supports passkeys; in fact, I use Bitwarden too daily and it does fine. But NordPass identifies passkeys as a separate type of record which makes it very easy for me to see what's what. In any case, you might consider saving your passkeys to a password manager like NordPass or Bitwarden before re-installing Windows. (I know that 1Password also has strong support for passkeys and I believe Dashlane does too; probably others as well now.)Comment 4: I came here looking for this initial question, and I understood what I already imagined the answer to be. However, I remembered an alternative which is Bitwarden, which also records the passkeys, so if formatting the computer I will have an alternative. 

The question is more for the ""Bitwarden"" community users in here:

Will I be able to store a previously created passkey for a website in Bitwarden? Or will it ask me to create a new one and derail the one previously created/stored on my computer??

Thank you for your commentsComment 5: ok, ill try this.Comment 6: Same problem, just moved to a different device.  If you want to replace your YubiKey, it is the same effort.

This is the downside to device-bound Passkeys -- they are, well, bound to one device.Comment 7: that is why device bound passkeys always require a backup passkey or atleast have another backup recovery option added to the account.  
In one way device bound passkeys are more secure i.e its on your TPM chip and can be protected by a boot password etc before Windows boots and one can be sure your passkeys are never stored in the cloud and can't be compromised even if we argue its encrypted and more convenient if it syncs across all devices.Comment 8: Yes. I've been using a cheaper version security key to store backups.

Wallets are not safe in high theft areas but it's quite easy to effectively reduce the chances that your wallet would be stolen. The same can be applied to any other physical item you have. This is nothing new, it's old hat - people have been deterring and preventing theft of property for hundreds of years. Maybe get off the Google and ask an old person how they kept their possessions from getting stolen all these years.Comment 6: Then don't use a PIN? Aren't there other methods to unlock your phone? Like fingerprint, hard to remember swipe patterns, face recognition? I am not even sure if you could setup passkeys if you only have a PINComment 7: With Passkey on a smartphone lock with biometrics they don't even need a gun

Just punching you unconsious and unlock it with your finger is enough. 😂🤣. You can even trick them by threating them for a drink until they pass out.Comment 8: Thanks, I'll keep my individual passwords then. I've been through gun to the head situation more than twice in my hometown.Comment 9: Yes, I do have a password manager with a different PIN. Thanks anyway!Comment 10: How can you do this with 1password?Comment 11: I own an iPhone 13 and use Face ID but it’s mandatory to have a PIN code as a backup as far as I know.Comment 12: Gun to the head is only one threat. Passkeys are also phishing resistant, so even if they don’t reduce the risk of being violently compelled to divulge a secret, they do significantly reduce risk in other scenarios. One’s overall vulnerability and thus risk would be lower with Passkeys vs passwords.Comment 13: What city?Comment 14: Okay and how would they get your face, when they are away from you? You have to authenticate again when actually using a passkey. It isn't enough to unlock your phone onesComment 15: Sounds like Gotham cityComment 16: São Paulo, Brazil. A fairly common crime here is 2 armed men that approach pedestrians and force them to give their PIN codes before getting away in bikes, in which they can easily disrupt the traffic jams and get from a busy location to the shady slums really fast.

With their PIN codes, they usually try to access bank apps to make transactions or commit other sort of frauds such as getting loans on the behalf of the victim. They may also use Messenger and WhatsApp to ask victims' friends and family for money.

That's why I use individual passwords so if my phone gets stolen along with my PIN code, they won't be able to do much harm. It already happened once to me and fortunately, they failed to access my apps due this.Comment 17: They'd use the backup PIN code that's is asked on iPhone if Face ID won't work. As I said I think that there's no way to exclusively keep Face ID as the only way to unlock the phone.Comment 18: São Paulo is pretty much like Gotham in many ways, mainly considering that is based on 80's New York. Even our National Theatre which holds our State Orchestra performances strongly resembles the one where the Wayne's parents were murdered as it is now located in a crackhead dominated Skidrow-like neighborhood.Comment 19: Wait...Doesn't Stolen Device Protection help a little with this?  That scenario is more violent of course but, as described, is similar to the shoulder surfing thief who sees you enter your passcode then steals your phone later.

In any case, the problem is falling back to device PIN when the face is not recognized. This feature should be disabled \[by Apple or companies\] for any critical feature or app on the device where comprise would be damaging.Comment 20: Well I am not familiar with iPhones. Simply try it out and if you think that would be unsafe in your situation, don't use it. It's still an option for nowComment 21: The original Gotham City goes back to December 1940 when it appeared in the ""Batman #4"" comic book.Comment 22: I'm using Stolen Device Protection since it was launched and it seems to be the best way to protect our devices for now. I was just reading more about passkeys because of the recent Playstation launch.Comment 23: I feel that we need something like the 5 x power button presses, that wipes the phone instantly. A self destruct button that the only recovery is to go and buy a new phone and restore from backup?

1b76fx8,Forcing storage of passkey to TPM on Android?,"Dear community

to understand the different ways passkeys/FIDO2 is used for authentication I learned about bot standards - in case of FIDO2 that was years ago. Using [webauthn.io](https://webauthn.io) and [passkeys.io](https://passkeys.io) I tried out different options and think I gained a good understanding so far.

I wonder if there is any way for me to have Android store passkeys on the device - in the TPM - only. I already used this before the big passkey update of Android last year (2023) and as far as I understand the keys have been stored on the TPM back then.

Do you know if there is a way I can setup Android for storing passkeys localy in the TPM only - skipping cloud sync?

Or what requirements need to be defined by the website for me to have the choice at least?

(As an example: On Desktop, I can use a Yubikey if the website implements the values ""Required User Authentication"", ""Attachment Cross-Plattform"", ""Attestation Direct"" and ""User Authentication Preferred"". - I would be interested to learn the neccessary values for TPM storage on Android )",mars-online,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1b76fx8/forcing_storage_of_passkey_to_tpm_on_android/,,,"Comment 1: It is ultimately up to the relying party (the website) to determine what kind of passkey they want. You can't really decide unless you are given the option. Most will go with synced passkeys now a days.

If you want to keep passkeys on a physical device, there are solutions out there for keeping passkeys on hardware; and, they're better than keeping them in a phone IMO - they don't get lost when you get a new phone and you're not tied to the one phone to have access to them.Comment 3: [deleted]Comment 4: Why would you want to do this and how do you think it could work?

The service you're setting up a passkey with needs *something* stored on their end to complete authentication, otherwise you're storing all credentials on your device with no way for the service to validate you're the owner of the account you're trying to access.

Went on my old phone and used the autocomplete/pass key to log in to a website. On the old phone It asked me for my lock screen passcode. As soon as I entered it on my old phone, there was a pop up on my new phone that asked for that same passcode.

In other words, my new phone asked me for my old phones password. I just had to actually use Google pass keys on an old device.

Hope that helps someone!Comment 4: Managed to fix the same issue in the following way:

1. Disable the lock screen via settings on the old phone

2. Try to log in to any site with a passkey via Chrome on the old phone

3. Chrome will ask to set up a screen lock, set it via the PIN option (the pattern didn't work for me).

4. Continue logging in with the passkey, Chrome should ask for the PIN.

5. Try to log in with the passkey via Chrome on the NEW phone.

6. Chrome should ask to set up a screen lock and then redirect to the Google page where you should enter the PIN from the old phone.

7. Should log in successfully after that.Comment 5: Hello,

I am experiencing quite the same issue with the passkey feature in an app called **CAKE by VPBank** (a domestic banking app in Vietnam) after performing a factory reset on my Xiaomi 11T device.

Previously, I had logged in to the app using my fingerprint (or Face ID) and enabled the enhanced authentication feature with a passkey. This meant that I would log in using my fingerprint or Face ID in combination with a passkey stored on my device (Xiaomi 11T).

Two days ago, I performed a factory reset on Xiaomi 11T, making sure to completely sign out of both my CAKE account and the Google account used to authenticate the device. I then signed back in using the same Google account on the newly reset Xiaomi 11T.

Now, many services and apps, including CAKE, recognize the previous Xiaomi 11T as an ""**old device**"" and the current Xiaomi 11T (after the factory reset) as a ""new device"" - even though we all know they are essentially the same one, right?!

So when I attempt to log in to CAKE again **using the enhanced authentication method with the passkey**, I receive the message: ""*Your encrypted data is locked on this device. For security, you can no longer access your encrypted data on this device. Try again using a device you have recently signed in to access your Google account.*"" However, **I am still able to log in to CAKE normally using fingerprint authentication without the passkey**. This is because the enhanced authentication feature is **optional** and it can be toggled on or off in the app's settings.

But my primary concern is to regain access to the enhanced authentication feature and use the passkey for added security. That's why I'm writing this comment.

I have read some of your suggestions here about trying using the old device to resolve the issue, but this is not applicable in my case since I no longer have access to a separate ""old device"" – it is the same device, just in a pre-reset and post-reset state.

Curiously enough, **the very same passkey** grants me seamless access when I log in on my iPhone. Everything works just perfectly. I'm led to ponder if this could be attributed to CAKE on the iPhone storing the passkey in iCloud rather than in my Google account, thus averting the issue?! And here, it’s also unclear if the same would happen with my iPhone if I am to factory reset it in the future. Basically, I still don’t quite understand how passkeys, passphrases, and/or on-device encryption work. Please check the screenshot.

So, I am looking for alternative solutions to this problem, for my Xiaomi 11T. I only use the default Chrome encryption option ""*Encrypt synced passwords with your Google Account*"" instead of the sync passphrase option so as to sync everything (including history, bookmarks, passwords, and other settings) to my Google account. If possible, I would like to avoid wiping my synced data (i.e., clearing sync data and starting over).

I would appreciate any assistance or suggestions from the community in resolving this issue.

Best regards,

What worked for me was resetting my Chrome synch encryption passphrase. I experimented with it years ago and never revisited it.  Once I reset the synch, I was able to create new passkeys (PlayStation, Amazon).

Here are the instructions from the Google search:

When you change your sync passphrase, all your data is deleted from Google’s servers and all your synced computers and devices are signed out. Your payment methods and addresses from Google Pay aren't encrypted by a passphrase.

Your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings aren't deleted from Chrome on your device. When you sign back in to Chrome on that device, all your info will start syncing again.

Step 1: Remove the sync passphrase

On your Android phone or tablet, open the Chrome app ￼.

Go to the Google Dashboard.

At the bottom, tap Clear data ￼ Clear.

To the right of the address bar, tap More ￼ ￼ Settings.

Tap Sign in to Chrome.

Sync will start again, and you'll no longer have a sync passphraseComment 8: i have the same on PC for google accountComment 9: Im on a Moto Edge Plus 5G and get the same message, but using my password works. I dont mind using my password - prefer it actually - but I am frequently - but not always - directed to the passkey page, to be told that it is inaccessible to me.
I really don't mind not having to use a passkey, but I would love it if someone could tell me how to make it stop directing me there automatically so that I have to back out of there to go back to my login screen to put in a password. 


Thanks!Comment 10: Same problem caused by someone changing my lock screen password. I switched back to old phone and getting this msg. It's going to be a while before I even reset the new phone because there is a ton of data on it I need to try like hell to save. Thanks Google for taking away that option!Comment 11: Just ran into this issue while trying to backup my timeline data. I lost my old phone, and can't recover it using the find my device option. I have my contact info on my screen I believe, so hopefully it turns up, but I know it's gone for good. It's not even letting me backup the timeline data from my ""new"" phone (and old phone I've had for years). Is this functionality just gone forever?!?! I've fully recovered my google account everywhere else on all my other devices, what's up with this?!?Comment 12: Guys pleeaee help me I am in the same trouble on robloxComment 13: Hi there,

It sounds like you're experiencing some frustrating issues with on-device encryption and passkey storage on Android. The error message you're seeing suggests that the encrypted data is tied to a specific device state and may require recent authentication on a device linked to your Google account.

Possible Solutions:

1. Recent Device Authentication:

   - Ensure you have recently logged into your Google account on the device in question. Sometimes a fresh login can reset the encryption status.

   - Try accessing the data on a device where you have recently signed in to your Google account.

2. Check for Software Updates:

   - Make sure your Android device is running the latest version of the software. Updates often include bug fixes that can resolve such issues.

3. Clear Cache and Data:

   - Go to Settings > Apps > \[App Name\] (the one you're using for passkeys) > Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data. This can sometimes help reset the encryption handling.

4. Reboot in Safe Mode:

   - Restart your device in Safe Mode (usually by holding the power button and then tapping and holding 'Power off' until the 'Safe Mode' option appears). This can help determine if a third-party app is interfering with the encryption.

5. Use Alternative Security Solutions:

   - If the built-in options are not meeting your needs, consider using dedicated security and encryption apps. For example, apps like Signal offer robust encryption for messages and calls, while password managers like Bitwarden provide secure passkey storage.

A Note on Secure Devices:

If you find these solutions cumbersome and are looking for a more straightforward approach to maintaining security and privacy on your device, you might be interested in devices specifically designed for enhanced security, such as the StellarProtect phone. It offers built-in, always-on encryption and a host of other features designed to keep your data secure without the hassle of constant troubleshooting.

Hopefully, one of these suggestions helps resolve your issue. If not, it might be worth exploring dedicated secure devices for a more seamless experience. Good luck!Comment 14: I'm having the same issue, removing all devices from ur account doesn't work. Relogging into same google account on that device also doesn't work.Comment 15: I'm on a Pixel!

Using Android 14 QPR1 AP21.240119.009Comment 1: I'm right there with you. Been pulling my hair out about it for 2 days now...Comment 2: Same. PlayStation send you here too?Comment 3: I got a new phone and I had the same issue and here is what worked for me. 

Went on my old phone and used the autocomplete/pass key to log in to a website. On the old phone It asked me for my lock screen passcode. As soon as I entered it on my old phone, there was a pop up on my new phone that asked for that same passcode.

In other words, my new phone asked me for my old phones password. I just had to actually use Google pass keys on an old device.

Hope that helps someone!Comment 4: Managed to fix the same issue in the following way:

1. Disable the lock screen via settings on the old phone

2. Try to log in to any site with a passkey via Chrome on the old phone

3. Chrome will ask to set up a screen lock, set it via the PIN option (the pattern didn't work for me).

4. Continue logging in with the passkey, Chrome should ask for the PIN.

5. Try to log in with the passkey via Chrome on the NEW phone.

6. Chrome should ask to set up a screen lock and then redirect to the Google page where you should enter the PIN from the old phone.

7. Should log in successfully after that.Comment 5: Hello,

I am experiencing quite the same issue with the passkey feature in an app called **CAKE by VPBank** (a domestic banking app in Vietnam) after performing a factory reset on my Xiaomi 11T device.

Previously, I had logged in to the app using my fingerprint (or Face ID) and enabled the enhanced authentication feature with a passkey. This meant that I would log in using my fingerprint or Face ID in combination with a passkey stored on my device (Xiaomi 11T).

Two days ago, I performed a factory reset on Xiaomi 11T, making sure to completely sign out of both my CAKE account and the Google account used to authenticate the device. I then signed back in using the same Google account on the newly reset Xiaomi 11T.

Now, many services and apps, including CAKE, recognize the previous Xiaomi 11T as an ""**old device**"" and the current Xiaomi 11T (after the factory reset) as a ""new device"" - even though we all know they are essentially the same one, right?!

So when I attempt to log in to CAKE again **using the enhanced authentication method with the passkey**, I receive the message: ""*Your encrypted data is locked on this device. For security, you can no longer access your encrypted data on this device. Try again using a device you have recently signed in to access your Google account.*"" However, **I am still able to log in to CAKE normally using fingerprint authentication without the passkey**. This is because the enhanced authentication feature is **optional** and it can be toggled on or off in the app's settings.

But my primary concern is to regain access to the enhanced authentication feature and use the passkey for added security. That's why I'm writing this comment.

I have read some of your suggestions here about trying using the old device to resolve the issue, but this is not applicable in my case since I no longer have access to a separate ""old device"" – it is the same device, just in a pre-reset and post-reset state.

Curiously enough, **the very same passkey** grants me seamless access when I log in on my iPhone. Everything works just perfectly. I'm led to ponder if this could be attributed to CAKE on the iPhone storing the passkey in iCloud rather than in my Google account, thus averting the issue?! And here, it’s also unclear if the same would happen with my iPhone if I am to factory reset it in the future. Basically, I still don’t quite understand how passkeys, passphrases, and/or on-device encryption work. Please check the screenshot.

So, I am looking for alternative solutions to this problem, for my Xiaomi 11T. I only use the default Chrome encryption option ""*Encrypt synced passwords with your Google Account*"" instead of the sync passphrase option so as to sync everything (including history, bookmarks, passwords, and other settings) to my Google account. If possible, I would like to avoid wiping my synced data (i.e., clearing sync data and starting over).

I would appreciate any assistance or suggestions from the community in resolving this issue.

Best regards,

The real QA question ought to be if the failure is reported or ignored.Comment 8: Let's assume I started passkey registration process when the device gives me a prompt to save passkey which is almost always a sperate window I disconnect from internet manually for testing purpose then I click save in this flow what should the device do? Since it won't be possible in any way for 3rd party to know if the authentication process was finished. I tried this on windows 11 and windows saved passkey on device while it was obviously unusable on the website.Comment 9: Are you complaining that the device followed your instructions by saving when you told it to?

I would much rather err on the side of keeping bad data than losing good data."

If every single password is long, complex and unique then a breach won't impact you any more with a password than passkey. If you never use said password then it has no possibility to intercepted. 

By complex I mean looking like this:

The biggest threat to passwords these days is repeated use of passwords. This comes from poor storage or transmission. Using Passkey and not using your password you can't delete but set up as above fixes all of that.Comment 10: If someone hacks a website/service where you have an account/login your password is the least of your concerns. The site/service in it's entirety is compromised and your password is A) Not needed and B) Not useful. There is a caveat with B if you are terrible with passwords and one of those people that reuse passwords at different sites.

The security benefit and primary purpose of passkeys is to keep people from easily giving away passwords to nefarious actors that con users out of them. That's really all passkeys do, they don't make things unhackable on your side or the site/service side - they just keep you from giving away passwords, choosing weak passwords, and reusing passwords. Behind the scenes passkeys use passwords/secrets of their own to log you in to sites/services but you the user don't get to see, touch, or chose them.Comment 11: Interesting. I have never had a website present a QR code. Heck, some sites that I created passkeys for don't even let me use them.  CVS is a classic example. I login with a password, it asks me if I want to create a passkey. I make the passkey, and I log out and it lets me login with the passkey. But if I close the browser and reopen it, or switch to another browser, no option to login with a passkey.Comment 12: Only the crappiest of sites stores passwords in plaintext. Storing salted hashes of passwords has been the industry standard for decades now.

Speaking of standards, Password reuse is a no-no. If a site should get hacked and your password discovered it shouldn't affect you because that password should have only been for that already hacked site and never used anywhere else.Comment 13: If there is a breach, it's true that they only get your password to one site, BUT…

What if that site is your bank and they login and transfer a large sum of money via Zelle to another account?

Or what if it's your email account password? Now they can reset the password to any website where you have that email address set up.

Even if someone gets your reddit or Facebook password, they could login as you and post a ton of racist ramblings and other undesirable things and cost you that job you've been interviewing for.

And there's always the problem of your password manager getting breached. Lastpass taught us that can be a thing. And some of the passwords in those vaults had very low PBKDF iterations and were cracked.

What really annoys me is that SQRL solved the password problem, and most of the issues with passkeys long before passkeys came along, and the world just ignored it.Comment 14: If you’re on iOS or macOS you might need to go into Settings > Passwords, select the CVS keychain item, click the Edit button on the bottom of the panel, and delete the password from the keychain entry (which right now on your system is storing both the password and the passkey).

Another way to look at it is; a burglar can use your house keys to get in to your house, but if they break-in without using your house keys, they don't need your house keys to burglarize your home - no protection is offered by the burglar not having your house keys and they don't need to obtain them to complete the burglary.","Passkeys are pretty convenient.

1aov4m6,What's the point of Google Chrome creating synced passkeys on Android if I can't use them anywhere else?,"I've been experimenting with passkeys for my GitHub account. I'm using Chrome on all of my devices.

When I create a passkey on my Mac laptop, a device-bound passkey is created. I can then use that to re-login on the same Mac and not on any other device. All clear so far. Not multi-device friendly, but clear.

When I create a passkey on my Android phone (Android 13, Chrome 121), it creates a **synced passkey**. I suppose this means my private key is saved into Google Password Manager's vault, shared to my Google account's cloud storage, and then gets into Google Password Manager's vault on all my other devices, including my Mac.

My expectation is that since this is as synced passkey, I'll be able to use it on my Mac as well, verifying my identity through Touch ID. However, I can see that **Chrome on my Mac doesn't see the synced passkey created on Android**.

OK, weird, but maybe I can at least **use the same synced key to log in on my backup Android phone** (Android 10, Chrome 121)? **Seems like I can't**. GitHub doesn't even suggest to use a passkey in this case, although the latest Chrome is used and Android has been FIDO2-certified since, like, forever.

What am I missing here? Is there any misunderstanding or false expectation? Chrome on Android creates a synced passkey by default, but it looks like I can't use any benefits of syncing.",gorohoroh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1aov4m6/whats_the_point_of_google_chrome_creating_synced/,,,"Comment 1: Certain password managers fix this issue, I use 1Password and it stores a single passkey per login and works on all my devices that support passkeysComment 2: The only real answer is probably ""it's a mess"" just like the whole Passkeys rolloutComment 3: I know it's 2 weeks later , but if you haven't figured this out yet, it's not a chrome sync issue.  If you are on a Mac Chrome can't sync passkeys like it can on Android. On Mac Chrome doesn't store the passkey.  The passkey is stored in your icloud Keychain.  It will work on any ios/Mac device that is logged into the same icloud account.  

So having a mix of android , iOS , and windows devices requires creating 2 separate passkeys for syncing to work.  One is synced with Chrome and then the other is synced with icloud.   This is not an chrome/google issue.  Apple doesn't allow passkeys to be stored outside of the icloud Keychain.  

It's kind of a pain but all you have to do is make sure to log in on the mac on any account you make a passkey for.  Personally I've gone to using a hardware security key so I'll always have a backup.Comment 4: Well if you want to introduce passkeys support on different devices, it does make sense to have the sync service up and running first actually – if the intention is to synchronise. Otherwise every device has a passkey for site Y, and then you turn on sync and end up with lots of passkeys per site in your credential manager...

But for my part, I think synchronising passkeys negates a lot of its benefits.

Passkeys are inherently more secure than password because you do not transmit the passkey to log in, hence it cannot be stolen from the website you log into for example. Devices have secure enclaves and TPMs and whatnot. Synchronisation through a cloud is less secure than staying on device.

BUT, if you start synchronising it over a password manager, then it can be stolen from your password manager. This significantly weakens the above benefit in my view.

Finally, I agree with everyone on this post that the UI for passkeys is a terrible and inconsistent mess.Comment 5: There are ecosystems for managing passkeys and they don't mix.    If you create a passkey on apple ecosystem you can't have the same passkey synced to your Google ecosystem.

You can use a passkey on one ecosystem on another device but the passkey is not synced when you use it.

This is where ecosystems like 1password are OS agnostic.

If you use both OS ecosystems you can just register multiple passkeys, one on each tooComment 6: man this sounds like a mess indeed.

I'm sticking with my Yubikey I'm able to use on my Pixel, iPadPro, and MBP both in macOS & Ubuntu until the dust settles!Comment 7: if you are using a device for the first time, you might have to click on sign in with a passkey by clicking on other login options instead of trying to enter a password and 2FA code.  
I haven't used Android/Google Password Manager so can't comment on its sync capabilities, but when logging in from windows desktop using a passkey stored in iOS keychain if I select passkey option on GitHub or Google I am prompted to scan a QR code and login using the hybrid model where the passkey is on a different device.  
Google by default doesn't prompt me the passkey option to sigin and I have to manually click sign-in using passkey to login using the passkey flow.  
Do you see your passkey synced to your Google account password manager at [Password Manager (google.com)](https://passwords.google.com/)?  
  
Note, the only true passwordless flow I have seen working is my Outlook/Microsoft account with the Microsoft Authenticator app and the password deleted on the microsoft account.Comment 8: Just to be sure, it wasn't specified, but did you use the same Google account for both Android devices? You can check your passkeys on your Chrome settings as well.Comment 9: What do you mean a single passkey per login?Comment 10: But you can use other password managers than keychain though. You can use enpass and 1password to create your passkey, which will then be available on ANY device (unless I'm getting this aren't )


So apple doesn't force you to use keychain, they force you to use, well, a password manager 


I imagine google could fix it by implementing some NON WEB app , and integrate into macOS password manager (within macOS system settings ) 


Can you use other password managers to create and sync passkeys on iOS ? Since IOS has chrome and bitwarden as a password manager , system wideComment 11: Hmm, but when I create passkeys in Chrome on Mac, it always asks me where to save them. iCloud is one of the options but I've never used it.Comment 12: Yeah, but I didn't try to mix ecosystems. I had created a synced passkey via Google and tried to use it on another device via Google (Chrome & Google Password Manager). It's not that I had created a passkey synced via iCloud and then tried to use it via Google Password Manager.Comment 13: I don't believe you currently even have any options other than  USB keys on UbuntuComment 14: The login flow with a QR code doesn't require a passkey on your phone to be synced, I believe, it can perfectly be device-bound.

I do see the passkey in my Password Manager, yes, which is what puzzles me.Comment 15: Yeah, same account.Comment 16: Ah, I'm guessing this means ""per account"".Comment 17: If you did then they will sync to other Mac and ios devices.  Say you do it on chrome on Mac.  Open in Chrome on ios and it won't be available.  If you do it in icloud it's available on ios.  It's yet another artificial limitation imposed by Apple.  

I don't work with Mac hardly at all anymore.  I sill have my old iPhone that I use mainly as a backup storage key.  I broke out my old Mac book air just to test with passkeys a while back and that's they only way to get then to sync.  I did some googling on it and its an apple limitation.  

I have the exact opposite situation as you.  I can't get them to reliability sync between android devices.  I've had to use my security key or the qr code on every new device.  I went so far as to use another android and set it up from scratch with my same Gmail account and could not get one passkey to actually work.  I've kind of given up caring.  All I want is to make sure if I lost my phone I could access my accounts.  That's what originally got me to get out the iPhone.   I have everything on my iPhone and security key as well as windows.  

I just recently started getting more serious with passkeys.  My next 3 day weekend I plan to sit down and try to figure it all out.  Maybe I missed something with syncing with Google password Manger.  I probably did.  I just wanted to let you know about the apple way of doing it.  Syncing between ios and Mac is seemless.  Since passkeys is a promoted by Google so hard I would have expected it to work alot more seamlessly on android.Comment 18: you're probably right.  all I know is the end result feels like better standardization across platforms (using FIDO2) and totally get Passkeys are very early in the implementation cycle!Comment 19: No fix ?Comment 20: Correct","I've been experimenting with passkeys for my GitHub account.

GitHub doesn't even suggest to use a passkey in this case, although the latest Chrome is used and Android has been FIDO2-certified since, like, forever.

What am I missing here? Is there any misunderstanding or false expectation? Chrome on Android creates a synced passkey by default, but it looks like I can't use any benefits of syncing.Comment 1: Certain password managers fix this issue, I use 1Password and it stores a single passkey per login and works on all my devices that support passkeysComment 2: The only real answer is probably ""it's a mess"" just like the whole Passkeys rolloutComment 3: I know it's 2 weeks later , but if you haven't figured this out yet, it's not a chrome sync issue.  If you are on a Mac Chrome can't sync passkeys like it can on Android. On Mac Chrome doesn't store the passkey.  The passkey is stored in your icloud Keychain.  It will work on any ios/Mac device that is logged into the same icloud account.  

So having a mix of android , iOS , and windows devices requires creating 2 separate passkeys for syncing to work.  One is synced with Chrome and then the other is synced with icloud.   This is not an chrome/google issue.  Apple doesn't allow passkeys to be stored outside of the icloud Keychain.  

It's kind of a pain but all you have to do is make sure to log in on the mac on any account you make a passkey for.  Personally I've gone to using a hardware security key so I'll always have a backup.Comment 4: Well if you want to introduce passkeys support on different devices, it does make sense to have the sync service up and running first actually – if the intention is to synchronise. Otherwise every device has a passkey for site Y, and then you turn on sync and end up with lots of passkeys per site in your credential manager...

But for my part, I think synchronising passkeys negates a lot of its benefits.

Passkeys are inherently more secure than password because you do not transmit the passkey to log in, hence it cannot be stolen from the website you log into for example. Devices have secure enclaves and TPMs and whatnot. Synchronisation through a cloud is less secure than staying on device.

BUT, if you start synchronising it over a password manager, then it can be stolen from your password manager. This significantly weakens the above benefit in my view.

Finally, I agree with everyone on this post that the UI for passkeys is a terrible and inconsistent mess.Comment 5: There are ecosystems for managing passkeys and they don't mix.    If you create a passkey on apple ecosystem you can't have the same passkey synced to your Google ecosystem.

You can use a passkey on one ecosystem on another device but the passkey is not synced when you use it.

This is where ecosystems like 1password are OS agnostic.

If you use both OS ecosystems you can just register multiple passkeys, one on each tooComment 6: man this sounds like a mess indeed.

I'm sticking with my Yubikey I'm able to use on my Pixel, iPadPro, and MBP both in macOS & Ubuntu until the dust settles!Comment 7: if you are using a device for the first time, you might have to click on sign in with a passkey by clicking on other login options instead of trying to enter a password and 2FA code.  
I haven't used Android/Google Password Manager so can't comment on its sync capabilities, but when logging in from windows desktop using a passkey stored in iOS keychain if I select passkey option on GitHub or Google I am prompted to scan a QR code and login using the hybrid model where the passkey is on a different device.  
Google by default doesn't prompt me the passkey option to sigin and I have to manually click sign-in using passkey to login using the passkey flow.  
Do you see your passkey synced to your Google account password manager at [Password Manager (google.com)](https://passwords.google.com/)?  
  
Note, the only true passwordless flow I have seen working is my Outlook/Microsoft account with the Microsoft Authenticator app and the password deleted on the microsoft account.Comment 8: Just to be sure, it wasn't specified, but did you use the same Google account for both Android devices? You can check your passkeys on your Chrome settings as well.Comment 9: What do you mean a single passkey per login?Comment 10: But you can use other password managers than keychain though. You can use enpass and 1password to create your passkey, which will then be available on ANY device (unless I'm getting this aren't )


So apple doesn't force you to use keychain, they force you to use, well, a password manager 


I imagine google could fix it by implementing some NON WEB app , and integrate into macOS password manager (within macOS system settings ) 


Can you use other password managers to create and sync passkeys on iOS ? Since IOS has chrome and bitwarden as a password manager , system wideComment 11: Hmm, but when I create passkeys in Chrome on Mac, it always asks me where to save them. iCloud is one of the options but I've never used it.Comment 12: Yeah, but I didn't try to mix ecosystems. I had created a synced passkey via Google and tried to use it on another device via Google (Chrome & Google Password Manager). It's not that I had created a passkey synced via iCloud and then tried to use it via Google Password Manager.Comment 13: I don't believe you currently even have any options other than  USB keys on UbuntuComment 14: The login flow with a QR code doesn't require a passkey on your phone to be synced, I believe, it can perfectly be device-bound.

I do see the passkey in my Password Manager, yes, which is what puzzles me.Comment 15: Yeah, same account.Comment 16: Ah, I'm guessing this means ""per account"".Comment 17: If you did then they will sync to other Mac and ios devices.  Say you do it on chrome on Mac.  Open in Chrome on ios and it won't be available.  If you do it in icloud it's available on ios.  It's yet another artificial limitation imposed by Apple.  

I don't work with Mac hardly at all anymore.  I sill have my old iPhone that I use mainly as a backup storage key.  I broke out my old Mac book air just to test with passkeys a while back and that's they only way to get then to sync.  I did some googling on it and its an apple limitation.  

I have the exact opposite situation as you.  I can't get them to reliability sync between android devices.  I've had to use my security key or the qr code on every new device.  I went so far as to use another android and set it up from scratch with my same Gmail account and could not get one passkey to actually work.  I've kind of given up caring.  All I want is to make sure if I lost my phone I could access my accounts.  That's what originally got me to get out the iPhone.   I have everything on my iPhone and security key as well as windows.  

I just recently started getting more serious with passkeys.  My next 3 day weekend I plan to sit down and try to figure it all out.  Maybe I missed something with syncing with Google password Manger.  I probably did.  I just wanted to let you know about the apple way of doing it.  Syncing between ios and Mac is seemless.  Since passkeys is a promoted by Google so hard I would have expected it to work alot more seamlessly on android.Comment 18: you're probably right.  all I know is the end result feels like better standardization across platforms (using FIDO2) and totally get Passkeys are very early in the implementation cycle!Comment 19: No fix ?Comment 20: Correct"

199y319,Compromised devices?,"So, the one thing that I still haven’t managed to wrap my head around regarding passkeys is the idea of the security of passkeys on a device that has been rooted.

All of the descriptions of passkeys that I see online say that the passkeys “never leave your device“, but then a few paragraphs later, they mention that the passkeys are synchronized with all of your other devices via the Internet…sooooo the passkeys *do* leave the device in the sense that they are copied to your other devices logged in to the same device-wide account (Apple ID, Google, etc).

If an attacker manages to gain root access to a device with passkeys on it, what prevents the attacker from simply copying the passkeys to another device via the Internet? What ensures that the passkeys are only copied to the devices *you* want them to be copied to? Or is this not a problem that passkeys were designed to address?",Organic-Ganache-8156,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/199y319/compromised_devices/,,,"Comment 1: There are different ways that a passkey can be stored-- you've just described one method.

\- Passkeys that are stored in a dedicated external hardware device (Ex. YubiKeys)

\- Passkeys that are stored in the TPM chip/secure element of the device the user is using

\- Passkeys that are stored in/synced to the cloud (Ex. iCloud, or password managers like 1Password)

**If an attacker manages to gain root access to a device with passkeys on it, what prevents the attacker from simply copying the passkeys to another device via the Internet?**

Even with root access to a device I cannot exfiltrate private key material out of a secure element/TPM. What I *can* do is just use those passkeys (as long as I have the memorized credential/biometric to do so).

This is part of the risk/benefit of **cloud** synced passkeys, if you choose to use them.

**Benefit:** If I lose my laptop I don't have to worry too much about the passkeys that I may have stored in its TPM

**Risk:** If my iCloud account is compromised (via a recovery flow or otherwise), there is the *potential* that an attacker may be able to compromise other accounts. 

For some, the benefit outweighs the risk. For others, it's too risky and there are always ways of using passkeys in a way where the credential isn't stored in the cloud.Comment 2: [deleted]Comment 3: Thank you! Very informative.

OK, so then passkeys improve on authentication/handshake quality, but they don’t exactly address theft vulnerability via the cloud/Internet. And I have to wonder whether third-party passkey managers like Bitwarden are even *able* to store passkeys in the TPM/secure module, especially on iOS.

To me, all of that means they still aren’t suited to truly important sites (banks, etc) unless they can be stored strictly offline; I am definitely not storing my bank passwords in the cloud. I’m not sure if that’s currently possible on macOS, and I’m sure it isn’t on iOS, at least with the built-in keychain.

Thank you again for your answer!Comment 4: Right, I understand that part. However, as I understand it, the private keys do synchronize among all of my devices, at least on iOS. Assuming that that is true, then the private keys are capable of being copied from the device, because they are copied to my other devices via iCloud Keychain. If my device has been rooted, what prevents the attacker from copying the private keys to a device of his choosing?Comment 5: [deleted]Comment 6: From what I’ve read online, that’s how the system works; it’s not just iOS. Bitwarden, 1Password, Google’s system on Android…all of them sync passkeys among devices via the cloud.

I haven’t understood why I haven’t seen this potential issue addressed directly, so I’ve been assuming that I just haven’t fully understood how it works (especially given the proximity/Bluetooth safeguards that *do* exist regarding sharing passkeys via QR codes). But the fact that it still hasn’t been directly addressed (anywhere that I can find) is starting to worry me. If passkeys *are* vulnerable to this sort of attack, and it’s not possible to store them in a local-only keychain, there is no way in hell I’m using them for anything important.

I guess my main concern is whether I can restrict copying of my passkeys from my first verified device by requiring authorization from my second verified device, or if no such authorization is required and therefore a third copy can be made to any device if one of my 2 devices has been compromised.Comment 7: My plan is to use Bitwarden for my passkeys. The way I see it, passkeys when used by password managers, are an incremental increase in security, rather than something ""perfect"" if you will. Your post made me think that all the risks you mentioned are the same with normal password managers. If your phone is compromised, your password manager may be also. 
I would think that hardware keys like Yubikey are safer, but what if you lose it? What could someone do with a Yubikey they found on the street?
Thank you for your questions because I was wondering the same thing.Comment 8: Without the memorized credential (or biometric) to unlock the yubikey, a randomly discovered yubikey is useless to a stranger. Even if it’s not a stranger, and its an attacker who knows what they want to access, they are going to have a very limited number of attempts at determining the memorized credential and then the yubikey will lock foreverComment 9: Yeah, the risks seem to be at least similar. The value of passkeys seems to largely center around 1) being much more difficult to brute-force or “guess”, 2) making local attacks harder, and 3) making remote but non-rooted phishing harder.

Passkeys seem like an improvement overall. I hope I find it easy to keep some passkeys local-only. Hopefully they’ll make a v2.0 in a few years that addresses the question of authorized vs unauthorized devices & copying from the cloud.","So, the one thing that I still haven’t managed to wrap my head around regarding passkeys is the idea of the security of passkeys on a device that has been rooted.

All of the descriptions of passkeys that I see online say that the passkeys “never leave your device“, but then a few paragraphs later, they mention that the passkeys are synchronized with all of your other devices via the Internet…sooooo the passkeys *do* leave the device in the sense that they are copied to your other devices logged in to the same device-wide account (Apple ID, Google, etc).

If an attacker manages to gain root access to a device with passkeys on it, what prevents the attacker from simply copying the passkeys to another device via the Internet? What ensures that the passkeys are only copied to the devices *you* want them to be copied to? Or is this not a problem that passkeys were designed to address?Comment 1: There are different ways that a passkey can be stored-- you've just described one method.

\- Passkeys that are stored in a dedicated external hardware device (Ex. YubiKeys)

\- Passkeys that are stored in the TPM chip/secure element of the device the user is using

\- Passkeys that are stored in/synced to the cloud (Ex. iCloud, or password managers like 1Password)

**If an attacker manages to gain root access to a device with passkeys on it, what prevents the attacker from simply copying the passkeys to another device via the Internet?**

Even with root access to a device I cannot exfiltrate private key material out of a secure element/TPM. What I *can* do is just use those passkeys (as long as I have the memorized credential/biometric to do so).

This is part of the risk/benefit of **cloud** synced passkeys, if you choose to use them.

**Benefit:** If I lose my laptop I don't have to worry too much about the passkeys that I may have stored in its TPM

**Risk:** If my iCloud account is compromised (via a recovery flow or otherwise), there is the *potential* that an attacker may be able to compromise other accounts. 

For some, the benefit outweighs the risk. For others, it's too risky and there are always ways of using passkeys in a way where the credential isn't stored in the cloud.Comment 2: [deleted]Comment 3: Thank you! Very informative.

OK, so then passkeys improve on authentication/handshake quality, but they don’t exactly address theft vulnerability via the cloud/Internet. And I have to wonder whether third-party passkey managers like Bitwarden are even *able* to store passkeys in the TPM/secure module, especially on iOS.

To me, all of that means they still aren’t suited to truly important sites (banks, etc) unless they can be stored strictly offline; I am definitely not storing my bank passwords in the cloud. I’m not sure if that’s currently possible on macOS, and I’m sure it isn’t on iOS, at least with the built-in keychain.

1984z7e,Passkey Disadvantages - Parents / Work / Public Library,"I have 3 use cases where Passkeys would be personally challenging in future (in order of importance). Any solutions would be welcome:

**1. Parents**  
I have all of their usernames and passwords stored on my password manager (not iCloud), *and* on *their* individual iCloud Keychains. This allows them to log into apps on their iPhones without having to know a Master Password or use a dedicated password manager like I have, they just use their fingerprints. They can't use computers, or remember passwords, so Touch ID is amazing for them. But sometimes I have to log into their accounts on my desktop or laptop to do things for them when it comes to utility bills, online shopping, banking (sometimes), and many other scenarios. I used to live overseas and they would send me their SMS verification codes when I had to do things for them ""live"" on the phone. As Passkeys can't be stored in different password managers, this will be a nightmare in future if a certain websites only offer a Passkey option as I won't have the copy of those credentials in my personal password manager.

**2. Public Library Research**  
I use expensive market research databases in my public library sometimes. The USB ports on those dedicated desktop PCs are disabled, and each session is wiped clean once you log off. The only way to take home my notes and research is to log into my Google or Microsoft account and upload the screenshot files and Word/Notepad files to my cloud storage. I can easily log in because I have a memorable password phrase for both Microsoft and Google. Switching to Passkeys wouldn't allow me to do this because I would not be able to install my password manager onto that public PC (and nor would I want to!). 

**3. Workplace**  
The only thing I would want to log into at a new place of work is LinkedIn. Similar to the library scenario above, I would not want to install my personal password manager onto a work computer just to log into LinkedIn.

In summary, none of these are a problem right now as I use Username + Password + 2FA. But my worry is that once companies start forcing passkeys, this will become an issue in these scenarios.  ",raja600,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1984z7e/passkey_disadvantages_parents_work_public_library/,,,"Comment 1: A lot of these things are already addressed or being worked on.

1. If you are using the same password manager as your parents (for example iCloud Keychain or 1Password) you can put passkeys into a shared vault that you both have access to. This is new for iCloud in iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma. Also, most websites allow you to create multiple passkeys for a single account. So you can put a passkey in their password manager for them and a passkey in your password manager for yourself.
2.  and 3. QR code login works great. Enter your email address on a computer you don't own and you get a QR code you scan with your smartphone. Your phone authenticates with biometrics and you're in. I've used this before with iPhone and 1Password and it works great. Of course, the computer you are signing into must have updated software, but in a few years that issue is going to start disappearing.Comment 2: These are legit use cases but all the issues boil down to your preference to use passkeys with your personal password manager. If you're willing to ditch your password manager, passkeys can be synced across iCloud Keychain and Google's equivalent.  

So basically with a synced passkey setup, your parents passkeys could be synced (as long as yall are on the same iCloud account) and you could do a roaming authentication from your iPhone (scan a QR code) to login with a passkey on a shared device and work devices. 

For what it's worth, I do think that password managers will start supporting these use cases by enabling passkey syncing and roaming authentication. I can't speak to their roadmap thoughComment 3: Thanks. I didn't even know QR codes for Passkeys were a thing, that's very helpful. 

As for my parents, yes the challenge is that 1Password is very important for me as I store multiple info in there in addition to just login credentials. My parents don't, so Apple Keychain is fine for them. It's the cross compatibility with Passkeys that will be essential for me in future. They will never be able to use 1Password (I've tried), hence vault sharing is out of the question. They always forget the Master Password, and they get extremely frustrated with usernames and passwords as it is. As long as I can maybe keep a copy of their Passkey on my 1Password in future, that would be a positive. 

Thanks so much for your comment, it was very insightful.Comment 4: 2+3 That could work if you had a phone with you, but it's basically a roadblock to make logging in harder for the people who should have simple access.

Passkeys just add unnecessary steps and device dependency to the login process.

195m7m8,Here's an interesting Idea that would make passkey safer for account sharing.,"When I heard about Bitwarden supports Passkeys.  (we can now share credential to a family members with only passkey)

Can we now share an account to someone without letting them know the password? this means they wouldn’t be able to change my password to take over my account, they do not know my current password.

&#x200B;

so I tested it.

it took me 2 troll account (if a Microsoft recovery team is here.. don’t mind the [johnweak@yopmail.net](mailto:johnweak@yopmail.net) account those are throw away test account).

&#x200B;

[Account take Over](https://reddit.com/link/195m7m8/video/059fo52a47cc1/player)

&#x200B;

So here is the video on how it can be taken over.

1. Get a copy of the recovery code.
2. Turn the 2FA off
3. Change password
4. Use the recovery code
5. Use the Passkey to enter
6. Once inside . Remove the Passkey
7. Turn on 2FA (Choose Any)
8. it’s yours.

&#x200B;

Passkey really have potential to be the safest way to share your account if done right.

and an idea come in mind. if developers added an access level on passkey similar to project management this will work.

here. I used my own account with 2 passkey .. with my **Bitwarden** and a **Yubikey** as example I added an **access level setting** for each security key for better perspective.

It seems like this is not going to happen unless an increase of crimes of account take over increases and laws were written to require it.  good luck to that.

the reason behinds is that if they do this, passkey will become a perfect security log-in.  but behind such incredible achievement.  it will also become the best way to share an account.

and corporations don't want that.  we all knew why Netflix is cracking down password sharing, so between choosing a perfect account security vs Revenue.  they surely choose the latter.

&#x200B;",Chibikeruchan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/195m7m8/heres_an_interesting_idea_that_would_make_passkey/,,,"Comment 1: This is already a solved problem that has nothing to do with passkeys. Services that want to allow different access levels to users do so with account permissioning and multiple accounts (e.g. child accounts with limited access to features controlled by the parent account, cloud resources owned by a company with access controls to restrict what different employees can do, etc).Comment 2: Then that means the next solution was turning on and turning off 2FA must be locked with a pin.

Coz when I test it I failed a takeover on the first troll account  and was locked (pending) for 30 days.  In this video it also show a failure on changing password when 2FA is still turned on. 

The only time I succeeded was after I turned off 2FA first.

This solution also works for account take over for people who already died in which your account is shared to a family member using only a passkey. It doesn't matter if they waited (pending) for 30 days for that.. The owner is dead and won't cancel the pending request.Comment 3: I don’t think you understood what I’m saying. It has nothing to do with passkeys and sharing a single account.

What you want as I understand it:
To share features of your online accounts with other people in such a way as to prevent them from performing a full takeover of the accounting which controls that access. For example, if you had a Netflix subscription, to allow others to watch movies through your paid membership.

How you are proposing to solve this problem:
Allow users to log into a single account with different permissions based on the credentials they provide during authentication.

The correct solution is to give each person their own account, and have the primary account (e.g. the one with the Netflix subscription) grant access to the shared features to those other accounts. Passkeys are simply an implementation detail and should play no role in determining the level of access to resources that an account should have.

The other thing to keep in mind is that this is entirely up to the business model employed by the companies in question. For example, it’s not in Netflix’s interest to allow users to share subscriptions, so they have no reason to implement any sort of changes in that regard.Comment 4: That's make sense.  Thanks

This means the chances of this happening is nearly zero unless the case of physical account take over increase such as.. 

People making you drunk at a bar and uses your phone as passkey enter your biometrics to take over your account with the process I did here. (it took me 5 mins to do it with the change password failure in the video but in real world it would probably take less)

Passkey really is the greatest threat to phishing coz there is nothing to phish but criminals are humans too they will adapt and soon switch to physical act.Comment 5: So it looks like passkeys won't protect you from xkcd either :)

https://xkcd.com/538/Comment 6: maybe leave your physical security key in your room when you are planning to be in a bar/public place?  
this is no different than someone else being able to login using a physical security key (without biometrics) which doesn't belong to them.  


I would say passkeys are safer, because lets say a thief steals someone's phone and some how managed to open an logged in session and when they try to change the password/passkey the website is going to ask them to re-authenticate, with a password it is easy as lets assume they have found it from the phone but with a passkey they cannot login as it would require the original FaceID and no passcodes will work,  
so I think passkeys linked to FaceID or Windows Hello Face recognition is much better than even physical keys.  
Because if they had managed to get the physical key, all they needed to do would have been to tap on the NFC to validate the login.Comment 7: 5 years from now... bars somewhere in the dark alley be like  
Unli Booze : Requirement  bring your phone with you.    


XDComment 8: No it doesn't matter if you have faceID and it doesn't matter if they don't know your password. as per the video.  once they got inside your account they don't need your password to change your password. they already have access to your recovery code inside your security setting.  what they need to do is turn off 2FA and use recovery code. easy as that.

the fix to that security loophole is to hide the security setting behind a pin.

doing so will make passkey the most secured login session there is. but with a catch... it will also be the best and safest way to share your account.

and big corp doesn't want that. they don't want you sharing you game library to anyone, the way netflix is cracking down account sharing.

so they won't do it. they won't support making their security setting perfect.

&#x200B;

\---------------

I actually found an account that secure their 2fa setting with 2fa via sending a pin to the recovery email.

And it was STEAM from valve I found it while I was updating old accounts in my bitwarden yesterday

But steam doesn't support passkey yet. And would probably never if they found this post and see how it will end their gaming platform via account sharing 😂

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Yubikey 5 series is the best passkey there is right now. coz it requires a pin. it doesn't matter if someone stole it while you are drunk in a bar.  they still need your pin.  unless you are the kind of guy who gives that information while drunk 😂

but the new **yubikey bio with biometric is the worst yubikey there is.**

coz again.. they can easily make you touch your own yubikey without your consent while drunk.Comment 9: *Now I'mma tell you what; uhh...*

***I likes ya;***

***and I wants ya.***

*Now we can do this the easy way;*

*or the haard wayyy...*

***the choice is yaawrs...***Comment 10: what you are describing is similar to you giving someone you trust your netflix password and expecting them not to change it, using passkeys won't solve that.passkeys are not for access control, passkeys are just passwords but more secure.In your video, a typical user would need your password and 2FA or a passkey like shown in your video to get to the accounts page in the first place.but lets say you have shared your passkey with someone so that they can view your outlook email address or view your onedrive files and if they go to view/change the security settings for that account they would be prompted with a 2FA challenge or asked for passkey again before they (or even you) are given access to the accounts settings (the challenge might also depend on how recently they logged into the mail account before navigating to accounts settings though not sure).In your scenario they have the recovery code only because you granted them access to that page to view/generate the recovery code in the first place.Even if you had used yubikey to store the passkeys I believe you can replicate the same behaviour as you have shown in the video as you have let them access into the accounts page with a valid authorisation.

but like another user posted what you are describing has nothing to do with passwords or passkeys, its just for the service to have some kind of access control.and most services solve this by allowing multiple accounts to share the same service with different profiles, parental control etc, so you don't have to share your passwords and let someone else take over your account even if it is your spouse or child.","When I heard about Bitwarden supports Passkeys.  (we can now share credential to a family members with only passkey)

Can we now share an account to someone without letting them know the password? this means they wouldn’t be able to change my password to take over my account, they do not know my current password.

&#x200B;

so I tested it.

it took me 2 troll account (if a Microsoft recovery team is here.. don’t mind the [johnweak@yopmail.net](mailto:johnweak@yopmail.net) account those are throw away test account).

&#x200B;

[Account take Over](https://reddit.com/link/195m7m8/video/059fo52a47cc1/player)

&#x200B;

So here is the video on how it can be taken over.

1. Get a copy of the recovery code.
2. Turn the 2FA off
3. Change password
4. Use the recovery code
5. Use the Passkey to enter
6. Once inside . Remove the Passkey
7. Turn on 2FA (Choose Any)
8. it’s yours.

&#x200B;

Passkey really have potential to be the safest way to share your account if done right.

and an idea come in mind. if developers added an access level on passkey similar to project management this will work.

here. I used my own account with 2 passkey .. with my **Bitwarden** and a **Yubikey** as example I added an **access level setting** for each security key for better perspective.

While working in the area of passkeys for a while and helping people on Reddit with their passkey problems (from a user perspective), I started to [collect](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-troubleshooting-solutions) **typical passkeys issues and how they can be solved**, so that others can get passkeys smoothly working.

Hope that it helps some of you when using passkeys for authentication:

[**See Passkey Troubleshooting Help**](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-troubleshooting-solutions)

Let me know if you have encountered any other error or problems where you might need help - I can add it to the list then.Comment 1: I have a problem when trying to use my phone for cross-device authentication.  Passkeys work fine if I sign in directly from my phone, but if I try to sign in on a different device I get the popup on my phone but the other device fails immediately with ""Something went wrong"" before I have a chance to confirm authentication on my phone (thumbprint scan).

I've tried testing different sites and on different devices with the same result.  I suspect it must be something with my phone (Android 12) but I don't have another one to test with.  There's not a lot of troubleshooting info out there right now, so hopefully you might have some ideas.Comment 2: Which operating system and browser (+versions) does the other device (the client, not your Android) have?Comment 3: I have the same issue. commenting for any solution at a later dateComment 4: Windows 11 Pro (22H2) with Firefox (122.0). Also tried Chrome (121.0.6167.140) with the same result.Comment 5: On your Windows device, do you have Bluetooth?Comment 6: Yes, if I disable it on the Windows device I get a prompt to re-enable Bluetooth temporarily.

The command does nothing on my Chrome browser under Windows 10.  I do have a **chrome://settings/Passkeys** command that shows passkeys stored in Windows Hello but it does not let me see resident keys stored in the Titan.

I'm asking because some on Reddit claim that the new Titan key runs a 2.0 version of CTAP that does not allow for that credential management.  They say the key needs version CTAP 2.1 to be able to manage individual creds.Comment 6: Thanks for the update. According to some, the inability to enumerate resident credentials is intrinsic to the Titan. I've also read there is a flaw in the attestation certificate that prevents enrollment at sites that check attestation.Comment 7: I confirmed this with a Titan I know has resident credentials.

It certainly works as stated for other brand security keys (e.g. Yubikeys).Comment 9: I wonder if this means that if I remove and re-enroll a passkey from a site where I have previously enrolled, will it overwrite the previous entry on the Titan key, or add another entry?Comment 10: I believe that is how it should work.

=====================

 We reviewed all the logs for the past month for Fido provisioning requests with aaGuid ""42b4fb4a-2866-43b2-9bf7-6c6669c2e5d3"" :

\- there are both successful and failed Fido provisioning requests for this aaGuid, totaling **557 requests across 214 tenants in the past 30 days**.

\- for ***ALL*** those requests, **attestation verification has been failing**, Spot-checking a few requests trace logs revealed that the failure return code is 800B010A (CERT\_E\_CHAINING). For the successful requests, the fido attestation policy was logged as disabled that means the ""enforce attestation"" is set to NO, which explains why they were successful.

For the current request (457ec583-31cb-472f-83e2-3be6a9a773fb / 12-08-2023 0:07:54Z), the same chain-build failure is happening (800B010A / CERT\_E\_CHAINING) but the attestation policy is enabled so the provisioning request is failing.

As to why the chain-build operation is failing, we spot-checked a couple of requests (including the current one), and the cert extracted from the authenticatorData seems to have some extra characters at the end:

MIICWz ... pKaDi+An4URA===== END CERTIFICATE ===

**Please ask the customer to contact their FIDO2 key provider - they would need to fix it as the attestation certificate is not correctly formatted (has additional unexpected characters at the end) resulting in chain build to fail.**

18emjjz,How are passkeys stored on Android phones?,"I would like to know how Google passkeys are stored on Android phones. If I am not mistaken, Google automatically created passkeys on the phones that are logged in to respective Google accounts, and there is no way to disable it. I know that passkeys for 3rd party websites (i.e., Amazon) are usually stored in Google Password Manager, but where does Google store its own passkeys? I can't see them in Google Password Manager.

Ideally, I would prefer if all my passkeys were stored only on hardware tokens such as Yubikey or Titan; however, it seems that smart phones alwould not be able to use those passkeys anyway.

If I am not mistaken, Google automatically created passkeys on the phones that are logged in to respective Google accounts, and there is no way to disable it. I know that passkeys for 3rd party websites (i.e., Amazon) are usually stored in Google Password Manager, but where does Google store its own passkeys? I can't see them in Google Password Manager.

Ideally, I would prefer if all my passkeys were stored only on hardware tokens such as Yubikey or Titan; however, it seems that smart phones alwould not be able to use those passkeys anyway. Instead, they can only use automatically generated locally stored passkeys that can be unlocked by using phone's current sign-in methods (fingerprint, face recognition, pattern, etc).

Is that an answer to your question? :-)Comment 2: To summarize: you are worried about a circular dependency.

TL;DR: 1) Google doesn't allow this circular dependency; 2) Google hasn't yet gotten rid of passwords on accounts; 3) and they still have account recovery flows.

Google does not allow you to store a Google account passkey for the same account in the passkey manager. You can store a Google account passkey for a different account in the passkey manager (which wouldn't have the problem you've described).

Android does have a passkey for each signed in Google account that can be used in hybrid passkey flows to log into Google on another device. But this isn't synced via the passkey manager.

Also, to summarize: to get access to your Google managed passkeys, you must sign into Google on a qualified Android device (high enough Android version and not a TV, IoT, etc) and *then* every your device lockscreen (PIN, password, pattern) from another Android device that was/is syncing to the passkey manager. 

For signing into Google, Google doesn't even let you sign into an Android device for the first time with a passkey (at least not now; presumably that will change in the future). They still require your password OR account recovery. 

Presumably, even if Google eventually offers the ability to get rid of your password, they will still have account recovery flows. They always have. And losing access to devices that have your Google passkey is a scenario that is much harder to blame on user error than forgetting a password.Comment 3: Thank you for the reply! Are you sure Bitwarden has full passkeys support on Android? I was testing with [demo.yubico.com/playground](https://demo.yubico.com/playground), it works fine with Bitwarden's dektop browser extension. But when trying to log in to that site on my phone there is only Android's native passkeys popup. I couldn't get the Bitwarden app to do it.

Re. the second part, Google would be my password manager. So if I get a new phone and no access to the old one, I would need to log in to be able to log in. In other words, I'd be locked out?

On the other hand, the way I see it, if Bitwarden is my password manager to which I know the master password of, I would be able to set up my main account on a new phone. That is, as long as I could install Bitwarden with no Google account set up (on the phone's initial setup I'd need to skip logging in to my main account), and Bitwarden fully supports passkeys on Android.Comment 4: Thank you, ""circular dependency"", that's exactly what tried to explain in many more words. Interesting that Google prevents it. Understandable, but kind of sucks that it's not possible to completely remove password logins yet. It's the weakest link after all, and it will keep being abused while it's there.Comment 5: Yes, if you use Google as your password manage. Or to handle the passkeys. On a new device you need to log in on your google account in order to be able to acces them. If you want to use a degoogled android phone and do not want to log in on you google account Bitwarden might be an option to handle the passkeys.

It was interesting that the Titan key box was branded as Google Cloud, even though it's not limited to use with Google Cloud.

So true..   2023 Titan key first and foremost needs a site that can test all the keys features without it being used for real.  It also needs more documentation as you stated.  I would also like to know what browsers and OS's support it, my MacOS with FireFox seems to not support it, but YubiKey 5 works fine..","Anybody knows how to reset a Google Titan key so that I can change the PIN code? I've accidentally setup the first Passkey with a PIN code that is too easy, but now every subsequent Passkey setup asks me to enter the silly PIN that I created.Comment 1: Answered my own question, 

Some security keys need extra verification, like a PIN.  
If your security key is locked due to multiple incorrect PIN entries and must be reset:  
On your computer, open Chrome Chrome.  
At the top right, click More More.  
Click Settings and then Privacy and security and then Security and then Manage security keys and then Reset your security key.

17wmzrc,"Passkeys and Security Keys - Recovery options, Shared keys, etc.","Hi,  

I'm slowly going through some services i use and enabling passkeys, ever since i noticed that Google already enables passkeys on each android device (which appear to be shared and linked to my google account?), which put my mind at rest a little when it comes to 'losing access'.  
&nbsp;  

I have a few questions that I'm hoping i can get answered -  
&nbsp;  

1 -  
Account recovery - Do the other recovery/verification options, such as MFA, SMS, Recovery Codes, etc. still apply?  
&nbsp;  
2 -  
Security Keys - My work was recently throwing out/replacing their existing base of Yubikeys with just standard windows hello / Touch sensor. As a result, I've got a YubiKey 5C Nano I'm playing around with.  

I added it to my Google Account, where it appears as a FIDO compatible passkey, but not as a security key (testing, i can add it to one or the other).For my MS account, i can add it as a straight security key only.  

Whilst i understand the implication that security keys are a far more secure way of logging into things, where supported, do the same recovery options as mentioned above, still exist?  
&nbsp;  

3 -   
Some sites, like Microsoft's support using a passkey via NFC/Bluetooth, and allow me to select, via Chrome, my other devices.  
But it never works. My phones (Android based), always say ""no passkeys available"" - why is this?  
&nbsp;  

4 -  
Is there a way to manage the keys stored on the YubiKey? I read it supports upto 25, but neither of the management app shows a list of what's there?  
&nbsp;  

5 -  
Shared keys - it looks like my google account shares the passkey between my android devices and Chrome, instead of individual keys - is this correct?

17s15ti,Passkey Cross-Platform Authentication via QR Codes and Bluetooth,"Hi,

When working on a WebAuthn / passkey implementation and testing with real-life users on different devices / browsers, I encountered one thing that caused a lot of **confusion and misunderstanding** (even some IT security folks at a local IT security meetup had issues understanding): **passkey cross-platform authentication via QR codes and Bletooth.**

To help overcome these misunderstandings, I gathered my findings in the following blog article:

[**Read blog post**](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-passkey-qr-code)

In my opinion, this way of cross-platform authentication will be a huge behavioral change for many non-technical users. As a website / app owner, I would try to avoid it (even it's not 100% technically possible as of now - see the article). What do you think about it?",vdelitz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/17s15ti/passkey_crossplatform_authentication_via_qr_codes/,,,"Comment 1: You are right. 

1. I've already come across a site that only plans to support device-bound passkeys. The only way for this to be practical is if ALL sites support both device-bound and synced passkeys so the user can choose which type to use on ALL their devices. And let's be honest, if I can login to an account from at least 4-5 different devices, device-bound passkeys are not the solution.

2. Passkeys completely ignore a large subset of users. Children, the homeless, the illiterate and the elderly are left behind. And once we're eventually forced to use passkeys instead of passwords, those people won't be able to log into anything at all. Try logging into Gmail on a public library computer if you don't have a phone or logging onto your family iPad owned by your mother. (And that's before we think about the ethics of storing and abusing a child's biometric data.)

3. It is illegal to force someone to share their password while forcing someone to unlock a device with biometrics is perfectly legal. Passkeys ignore basic human rights to properly secure their data from government agencies.

4. My phone's bluetooth is off by default as it is a security liability. I don't need to connect to other bluetooth devices. It makes it too easy for hackers to break in. So cross-platform authentication is out by Bluetooth is out, especially on old devices that don't even have Bluetooth-capabilities.

The whole idea is great in theory, but in practice, it's not workable. It relies too much on technology that isn't always available and it requires users to be more technical than they are.","Hi,

On iPhone, any app that is enabled to store passwords (Settings -> Passwords -> Password Options) will pop up when adding a new Passkey, allowing you to select which app to store it in.

Edge on Windows is a little more clunky.

It looks like the [user journeys described here](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/ux/user-journeys?hl=en) is not adhered to by many sites.  I had to dig into developer docs to see how different storage locations are prioritized if there are conflicts. [For example](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/passkeys-on-icloud-keychain/), from this article from Eiji Kitamura, Developer advocate for Chrome:

>Note that passkeys stored to the Chrome profile previously continue to be available, but ones stored to iCloud Keychain **are prioritized**. If only a passkey from Chrome profile is available, it will be used to authenticate the user.

I think the public key cryptography and core tech for passkeys are solid, but they have not considered end-user usability sufficiently in guiding site developers or worked hard enough to ensure adherence to good implementation. I guess this will take a long time to sort out.

On Chrome on macOS,  I can use iCloud Keychain, potentially a browser extension that supports passkeys, and the Chrome (local) profile. Understanding which one is used was a pain for me. Image what happens if the passkeys  for a particular site are outdated in one storage location.

It also gets confusing when a hardware device that stores passkeys are used. When I create a passkey, I need to be very careful where I store it. (e.g. Yubikey or Google Titan key. Note that iCloud Keychain is not one of the ""hardware"" bound storage devices for passkeys)

>[if the passkey exists on a phone it's not possible to use physical (USB or NFC) key](https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/17qyx25/disable_automatic_passkeys_generation_on_android/)","There are a few different directories online showing the list of sites that support creating and authenticating with passkeys. However, I haven't seen a list of apps that support the storing of Passkeys. Does any such directory exist? Here are the ones that I'm aware of:

iCloud

Windows Hello

1Password

Google Password Manager

Any FIDO2 compliant hardware key

Are there others?Comment 1: I believe I saw Bitwarden just released support for passkeysComment 2: NordPass supports passkeys.Comment 3: Bitwarden, DashlaneComment 4: Yubikey is a fido2 compliant hardware key.Comment 5: StrongboxComment 6: How are you supposed to select the correct storage option when multiple are available? I haven't seen any examples that allow you which place stores the passkey, which makes managing them a nightmare.Comment 7: I think it depends on the device.

On iPhone, any app that is enabled to store passwords (Settings -> Passwords -> Password Options) will pop up when adding a new Passkey, allowing you to select which app to store it in.

The main reason for that being that different websites support passkeys in different ways. It is a great idea in principle but because a lot depends on the actual implementation (and the fact that there is a variety of ways to implement), it makes for an inconsistent user experience in the real world…Comment 2: I don't like the fact that if you have a passkey on your phone and you decide to login into your Google account on your PC then you have to use a QR code each and every time to login. Its not like it was when I used to receive prompts on my phone and then I would simply select yes it was me signing in or not. If only passkeys sent a prompt to my phone and no more QR code for EACH and EVERYTIME I login to them then I wouldn't have any issues with it.Comment 3: Google & Amazon work great for me, but Microsoft seems to want me to delete my password if I want to set up a Passkey.

Just like 2FA solutions, a passkey requires me to have a second device available (with sufficient battery power) or store biometrics on a device so they can be stolen, or both.

Passwords are the standard for a reason.

The fact bluetooth may be needed is also a downside.

==> On Microsoft, you can since february, it's the decision of each site when they plan to let users delete their passwords, but that's the final goal everywhere. 

Google is planning to let users delete it from next year. 

But many sites still think that users would be too afraid of deleting it, so they are doing a smooth transition, one step at a time to not loose the non-technical usersComment 19: With Google and Apple specifically, even though the password exists it can’t be used on its own once you have 2-step authentication turned on, right?

In regards to not being able to export them, that’s something I LIKE about Passkeys. It’s what makes them phishing resistant.Comment 20: Can u tell me more about that? I’m very curious about it. If possible tell me as much details as possible, I’d be very grateful. 

ThanksComment 21: An application key should work for that :) It's a long key that is used in place of password + 2FA and that will still exist with passkeys for cases like thatComment 22: It's under work on mutliple providers :) Usually the encryption is not done via the password, but your password is used as a decryption key for the master key. 

Multiple providers are working to have a passkey that will also encrypt/decrypt the master key. Basically, they will encrypt the master key with each private key that needs access to it.

Do you think they can only be stored on phones or in the case of computers only if they have biometrics? Windows supports use of a PIN.

> Passwords are the standard for a reason.

Standards can progress.Comment 24: That is essentially what 1Password does. The problem is it doesn’t work on Mobile devices (iOS in my case) and is only useful on computers with a web browser that has the 1Password extension. So cross platform is a problem. Even then, like I said hit and miss.Comment 25: Absolutely and thank you for your efforts!!! Yes so here's my dilemma: 


I have a Pixel 6A so I have a passkey already set up on my device. Not a problem. Now I have already set up my account to use passkeys for authentication. The first time you do set it up I understand that yes you may have to use a QR code that the browser presents you with to login. But here's the issue. In theory this is only supposed to be just ONE TIME ONLY that you are required to use a QR code to sign in. But each and every time I log into my account now using my browser (which is Brave by the way since I don't like ads) it now always and I mean ALWAYS PROMPTS me to scan a QR code then I login into my account. 



Should I press no to the QR code it gives an error and it won't allow me to sign in. I have to then use my password instead. I really wish there was a solution where once you have already set the passkey on your phone then you shouldn't be prompted each and every time to scan a QR code to login. I just want it to be that now once I select passkey option to sign in to my account I instantly get a prompt on my phone asking is it me trying to sign in. Then I could just say yes and login. If there's a way to solve this then please please let me know ASAP. I would definitely appreciate it!!!Comment 26: Well.... Not everything I have supports passkeys or biometric authentication.  Some examples:

\- My Xbox

\- My Wireless scanner which scans to Onedrive

\- My Synology Server which backs up to Onedrive

If I delete my password/2FA, how will I sign into my Microsoft Account with a passkey on these devices?  Maybe some day they'll all support biometrics, and maybe there is a way around this, but it's not really described on Microsofts website.Comment 27: Don’t go try to create your own, go work with the cross-org FIDO Alliance if you want to help and have something to contribute.Comment 28: I think you are using the wrong term, because phishing is stealing user's credentials from a fake website that is a copy of the original one. 

With passkeys, that is impossible even if you are able to export them, because they are linked to a website domain (eg ""[google.com](https://google.com)""). 

If you accidentally share your passkey with an attacker, this is not phishing, but credential stealing.Comment 29: >In regards to not being able to export them, that’s something I LIKE about Passkeys. It’s what makes them phishing resistant.

I have seen this opinion before, but I don't really understand it. How an unencrypted passkey export would increase the risk of phishing? Phishing can happen when you enter your credentials into a fake website, right? But you don't enter your passkeys anywhere, anyway.Comment 30: https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/s/IfVT2HQYoUComment 31: Any tips for this?Comment 32: Nice!Comment 33: >Do you think they can only be stored on phones or in the case of computers only if they have biometrics?

I think requiring biometrics is a violation of privacy and the alternative (a PIN) is not secure enough. Therefore, the entire premise doesn't work.

>Windows supports use of a PIN.

A pin which is easy to guess and completely insecure. And earlier this week, it was also shown that the fingerprint biometrics of Windows Hello had been circumvented. Thus also not secure.

>  
Standards can progress.

Requiring someone to either hand over their biometrics or use an insecure device PIN is not progress. It will just mean being robbed involves robbers not just taking your phone, but your fingers as well. 

Also, if I use a Windows Hello pin, this would require me to make a separate passkey if I happen to not be near my PC, so instead of ONE password for all devices, I know need at least 4 different passkeys to properly log into my accounts from anywhere I want to. That is not a practical solution.Comment 34: You mean you can’t use the passkey you saved on 1password on mobile browsers? Even if you set up 1password as the main software  on Apple password manager?Comment 35: Thanks for this great answer and feedback my g. 

Have you already tried or researched about any way to allows you to do that? 

Just to clarify the things. You meant a way that you could connect the QR code once and then it’d work for sometime or even forever on that same device without the need to do the QR code scan each time you try to login, is that right? 

Also, a question: does the Passkey you’ve been using have a fingerprint or faceID system or only the QR code? Because I believe it’d solve your problem but not sure yet. 

Let me know and thanks for your reply and feedbackComment 36: I don't have this issue on my Pixel 7 Pro. The phone needs to be connected to your computer via bluetooth for it to communicate with it, and once its communicated a prompt appears on my phone and it asks for my fingerprint to complete the login.

Did you add your phone as a ""passkey"" in the google security settings, or under ""security keys"". I believe the latter is just for 2FA instead of single sign on so maybe that is the issue? Maybe the issue is you are using the brave browser while I am using chrome?Comment 37: Ok, I got what you mean, thanks for the explanation bro. Let’s keep in touchComment 38: Can you an app password?Comment 39: I don’t wanna be an employee, always prefer work for myselfComment 40: That’s an example of, but not the definition of phishing. And I’m not sure how it would even be possible to share a passkey with an attacker.Comment 41: Not being able to “export” a passkey from a secure enclave makes it so user also can’t inadvertently send them to attackers. Huge upside with almost no downside.Comment 42: > I think requiring biometrics is a violation of privacy and the alternative (a PIN) is not secure enough. Therefore, the entire premise doesn't work.

Because why? Biometrics data is stored locally on a separate chip inaccessible by the OS
> A pin which is easy to guess and completely insecure. And earlier this week, it was also shown that the fingerprint biometrics of Windows Hello had been circumvented. Thus also not secure.

Yes because all those hackers can use MY pin for MY device on THEIR computer to access my accounts.

>Requiring someone to either hand over their biometrics or use an insecure device PIN is not progress. It will just mean being robbed involves robbers not just taking your phone, but your fingers as well. 

Who are you giving your biometrics? Certainly not Apple. Your windows Hello face is also not stored on MS's servers. [Also If you're targeted physically you're already screwed anyways.](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security) This is about online security

> Also, if I use a Windows Hello pin, this would require me to make a separate passkey if I happen to not be near my PC, so instead of ONE password for all devices, I know need at least 4 different passkeys to properly log into my accounts from anywhere I want to. That is not a practical solution.

It's not like you need to remember those 4 passkey in your mind. Also plenty of services (iCloud Keychain or password managers store them encrypted in the cloud.)Comment 43: What makes you think a PIN is easy to guess or insecure compared to a password? PINs on Windows Hello are alphanumeric they are not just 4 or 6 digit numbers like other PINs. These are effectively just password that works only a specific device. 

What is not practical about having multiple passkeys compared to having one password for all devices? The device with the passkey would still need to be unlocked either way but with the passkey you would not need to enter any password. You can say maybe the process of making them but that would be similar to setting up 2FA.Comment 44: You're welcome anytime. And yes I have tried to research this (even leave comments on websites and even emailed a editor of an article about this) and there is no answer to my specific issue unfortunately. 


And yes basically what I mean is this: since the passkey is now on my phone and ready to go I wish I could just go to my PC and once I log with my user name I just get a prompt instantly on my phone asking me if I'm trying to log in now? For which once I select yes it's me then it should authenticate and sign me in since the passkey is already on my phone. Before passkeys became a thing, I kinda had that option with 2FA set on my Google account. Google at the time, allowed someone to use phone prompts to sign in without having to enter a password at all or scan a QR code each and every time. I would just select it was me once I got the prompt on my phone, and sometimes it would ask me to use my screen lock or for me to unlock my phone to login in or it would have a number on the screen and I would have to select it on my phone to login. 



And I'll humbly admit this, I'm not sure if this is the reason I'm constantly getting the QR code prompt on my PC, but for my passkey I thought (I thought) I could just use my screen lock for my phone as a passkey since I don't have any biometrics set up on my phone. Ive been using a password on my phone for years now and I thought I could use that as a passkey to sign into my Google account.


I don't know if I'm just misunderstanding how passkeys work but I really just like the simplicity of using Google prompts on my phone to sign in with and not having to use my password or a QR code now or anything else (constantly) to login with on my PC.Comment 45: Thank you for trying to help me with this. Google finally fixed it so now those issues have been resolved. All I do now is just sign in and select the passkey option and then once the drop down section comes on my PC about which device I then just select my pixel and then it signs me in without scanning the QR code again.Comment 46: I understand that, but for passkeys, it's definitely not the way to go. 

I love passkeys as well, I have been following the subject since the release of Webauthn in 2018, and they are using the same principles as PGP, so it could have been done since years, but the main lack was the synchronisation. And that required the big techs to work together with FIDO Alliance as well to get a working solution.

If you develop a solution alone, without being FIDO compliant, I think that the support would be poor among the websites and it wouldn't be so usable. 

It would be better to work with the existing solution and improve it if you can :)Comment 47: That's the thing, passkeys are made so the risk of a user sharing it with an attacker is lowered to the minimum. And that's working pretty well as currently the only way is to share it via a password manager to a user that you trust and that you added as a user that can access some of your vault items

And that's also why they still need to work on a secure way of exporting them at FIDO in general, because creating a way of exporting them without encryption would again create a risk of a user sharing it to the wrong person.Comment 48: Great but isn’t there another way to export or at least share it on cloud or something? 

By the way, what are your thoughts about fingerprint and FaceID? Is this really necessary for passkeys? I’m not sure if it’s the safest way because hackers can get your faceid and fingerprint.Comment 49: Not being able to export also means no way to backup or share with trusted people like employees or family members. That is a huge downside.Comment 50: The setup process is way too long. I have at least 300 accounts, all with a password safely stored in my password manager. Setting up a passkey for each of them is already more work than I'm willing to do. Setting up passkeys for all of my accounts times at least 4 different devices is madness.Comment 51: Man, thank you for the feedback. I’ve been doing some small research here before keep building the product. 

Really appreciate it. 

A question, for a better understand of your problem, would you be able to participate in a short survey a zoom call(voice or video) to talk about it? It’d help me a lot to understand your problem better to build a better product for you and for all people across the world. 

I’d say I have 70% of my passkey ready and this call would help because I can get your feedback. 

Let me know if you are open to it. 

ThanksComment 52: Great! It's a good idea to have a backup method of signing in case you lose your phoneComment 53: Passkeys can be synced among devices in an ecosystem (like between a Mac and iPhone via an iCloud account) and passkeys for an application can be created for multiple ecosystems, as well.

The biometric auth is part of what makes the passkeys phishing resistant. In terms of “safest” it’s way safer than a password.

In the end, though, if you’re here to learn more about Passkeys in general that’s great. If you’re here to just gather information in the hopes of launching a competitor that’s likely a losing strategy given the complexity and work that’s gone into passkey development.Comment 54: Your trusted people can add passkeys for your accounts. This isn’t a real argument.Comment 55: You're welcome anytime. And sure I wouldn't mind a zoom call or a survey to talk about this. I would like to do anything I can to help with resolving this and making things simpler for passkeys. Please let me know whichever works best for you and we can set something up.Comment 56: My thoughts exactlyComment 57: Im here for both my g, for learning and to create something related to passkeys(Maybe it’s not a passkeys but a way to save them or something similar) 

Have you already created one? I’ve been working on it for 2 weeks. 

What do you do? Are you a passkey specialist or something?Comment 58: Oh, let's stuff an account with multiple passkeys and waste storage space. That is not an improvement! The argument is that passkeys waste storage space. Forcing people to create even more passkeys is not going to solve that.

The whole point of sharing a password is that you have ONE item to share instead of having 4 passkeys for yourself and an additional X for each other person on the account, where X is the number of devices they use, where NONE of these keys are shared.Comment 59: Great to know bro. It looks you love passkeys. I’ll send you a dm and let’s schedule this zoom callComment 60: Yes I do and yes let's do this!!","I’ve been thinking about it and trying to collect some feedbacks and honest thoughts about it. 

ThanksComment 1: The fact that you need a new one for each device you connect with. 1Password lets you save them but only on a computer with a web browser that supports the 1Password plugin and even then it is hit and miss. The main reason for that being that different websites support passkeys in different ways. It is a great idea in principle but because a lot depends on the actual implementation (and the fact that there is a variety of ways to implement), it makes for an inconsistent user experience in the real world…Comment 2: I don't like the fact that if you have a passkey on your phone and you decide to login into your Google account on your PC then you have to use a QR code each and every time to login. Its not like it was when I used to receive prompts on my phone and then I would simply select yes it was me signing in or not. If only passkeys sent a prompt to my phone and no more QR code for EACH and EVERYTIME I login to them then I wouldn't have any issues with it.Comment 3: Google & Amazon work great for me, but Microsoft seems to want me to delete my password if I want to set up a Passkey.  I'm not quite ready for that because I don't know what it will break.Comment 4: What’s the point of focusing on “what don’t you love about passkeys”? There is so much more upside to Passkeys than downsides when comparing them against other authenticators (passwords, TOTP, etc) that I don’t understand focusing on the negatives in a vacuum.Comment 5: 1. You can't export your passkeys
  
2. Even when you'll be able to export them, it will be possible only in encrypted form, which means that you will always rely on an external app to have access to your own passkeys.
  
3. You can't delete your password, even if you want to, so the weakest link is still there.
  
4. Google creates a passkey for you on Android devices without asking you, which you can't delete.Comment 6: I dislike that Google and Apple know which sites I am registered in. Let me know if I have this wrong.Comment 7: The fact that I practically still can't use them to save them, since every time I try to save them on my Android 14 it tells me that there is a ""problem""... Try later...Comment 8: [deleted]Comment 9: That end-to-end encryption isn't in the protocol. A cloud drive service could easily be end-to-end encrypted. But at the moment that encryption is done via the password.Comment 10: Passkeys simply aren't practical or desirable. 

Just like 2FA solutions, a passkey requires me to have a second device available (with sufficient battery power) or store biometrics on a device so they can be stolen, or both.

Logging in should be simple without any hoops.
Passwords are the standard for a reason.

The fact bluetooth may be needed is also a downside. I should be able to log in without bluetooth shenanigans draining battery power and opening up my device to hackers.Comment 11: My g, can u tell me more about it? What if you could save it in an application that would allows you to use the passkey in any browser you’d like, would it help you? Lemme knowComment 12: Thanks bro. Can u please tell me more about it? I’m trying to understand to build a solution for it.Comment 13: So would you like both? Passwords + passkey as an option?Comment 14: Can u tell me more about the reasons for it? ThanksComment 15: I deleted my password on Microsoft since february, and basically they are using 2FA methods as a backup if you can't use your passkeys, because the 2FA is considered safe enough. The main 2FA being used is their Authenticator app sending you a one time request :)Comment 16: I’ve asked about the competitors. I’m doing a business thing here to try to understand what people don’t like about the current Passkeys to build a better one lolComment 17: Im focusing on understanding the problem with the current passkey to build a better version. I love passkeys, that’s why I’m doing it. I’m not trying to say it’s badComment 18: ""You can't delete your password, even if you want to, so the weakest link is still there.""

==> On Microsoft, you can since february, it's the decision of each site when they plan to let users delete their passwords, but that's the final goal everywhere. 

Google is planning to let users delete it from next year. 

But many sites still think that users would be too afraid of deleting it, so they are doing a smooth transition, one step at a time to not loose the non-technical usersComment 19: With Google and Apple specifically, even though the password exists it can’t be used on its own once you have 2-step authentication turned on, right?

In regards to not being able to export them, that’s something I LIKE about Passkeys. It’s what makes them phishing resistant.Comment 20: Can u tell me more about that? I’m very curious about it. If possible tell me as much details as possible, I’d be very grateful. 

ThanksComment 21: An application key should work for that :) It's a long key that is used in place of password + 2FA and that will still exist with passkeys for cases like thatComment 22: It's under work on mutliple providers :) Usually the encryption is not done via the password, but your password is used as a decryption key for the master key. 

Multiple providers are working to have a passkey that will also encrypt/decrypt the master key. Basically, they will encrypt the master key with each private key that needs access to it. 

You can find an explanation at the bottom here: https://proton.me/blog/protondrive-securityComment 23: > Just like 2FA solutions, a passkey requires me to have a second device available (with sufficient battery power) or store biometrics on a device so they can be stolen, or both.

Do you think they can only be stored on phones or in the case of computers only if they have biometrics? Windows supports use of a PIN.

> Passwords are the standard for a reason.

Standards can progress.Comment 24: That is essentially what 1Password does. The problem is it doesn’t work on Mobile devices (iOS in my case) and is only useful on computers with a web browser that has the 1Password extension. So cross platform is a problem. Even then, like I said hit and miss.Comment 25: Absolutely and thank you for your efforts!!! Yes so here's my dilemma: 


I have a Pixel 6A so I have a passkey already set up on my device. Not a problem. Now I have already set up my account to use passkeys for authentication. The first time you do set it up I understand that yes you may have to use a QR code that the browser presents you with to login. But here's the issue. In theory this is only supposed to be just ONE TIME ONLY that you are required to use a QR code to sign in. But each and every time I log into my account now using my browser (which is Brave by the way since I don't like ads) it now always and I mean ALWAYS PROMPTS me to scan a QR code then I login into my account. 



Should I press no to the QR code it gives an error and it won't allow me to sign in. I have to then use my password instead. I really wish there was a solution where once you have already set the passkey on your phone then you shouldn't be prompted each and every time to scan a QR code to login. I just want it to be that now once I select passkey option to sign in to my account I instantly get a prompt on my phone asking is it me trying to sign in. Then I could just say yes and login. If there's a way to solve this then please please let me know ASAP. I would definitely appreciate it!!!Comment 26: Well.... Not everything I have supports passkeys or biometric authentication.  Some examples:

\- My Xbox

\- My Wireless scanner which scans to Onedrive

\- My Synology Server which backs up to Onedrive

If I delete my password/2FA, how will I sign into my Microsoft Account with a passkey on these devices?  Maybe some day they'll all support biometrics, and maybe there is a way around this, but it's not really described on Microsofts website.Comment 27: Don’t go try to create your own, go work with the cross-org FIDO Alliance if you want to help and have something to contribute.Comment 28: I think you are using the wrong term, because phishing is stealing user's credentials from a fake website that is a copy of the original one. 

With passkeys, that is impossible even if you are able to export them, because they are linked to a website domain (eg ""[google.com](https://google.com)""). 

If you accidentally share your passkey with an attacker, this is not phishing, but credential stealing.Comment 29: >In regards to not being able to export them, that’s something I LIKE about Passkeys. It’s what makes them phishing resistant.

I have seen this opinion before, but I don't really understand it. How an unencrypted passkey export would increase the risk of phishing? Phishing can happen when you enter your credentials into a fake website, right? But you don't enter your passkeys anywhere, anyway.Comment 30: https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/s/IfVT2HQYoUComment 31: Any tips for this?Comment 32: Nice!Comment 33: >Do you think they can only be stored on phones or in the case of computers only if they have biometrics?

I think requiring biometrics is a violation of privacy and the alternative (a PIN) is not secure enough. Therefore, the entire premise doesn't work.

>Windows supports use of a PIN.

A pin which is easy to guess and completely insecure. And earlier this week, it was also shown that the fingerprint biometrics of Windows Hello had been circumvented. Thus also not secure.

>  
Standards can progress.

Requiring someone to either hand over their biometrics or use an insecure device PIN is not progress. It will just mean being robbed involves robbers not just taking your phone, but your fingers as well. 

Also, if I use a Windows Hello pin, this would require me to make a separate passkey if I happen to not be near my PC, so instead of ONE password for all devices, I know need at least 4 different passkeys to properly log into my accounts from anywhere I want to. That is not a practical solution.Comment 34: You mean you can’t use the passkey you saved on 1password on mobile browsers? Even if you set up 1password as the main software  on Apple password manager?Comment 35: Thanks for this great answer and feedback my g. 

Have you already tried or researched about any way to allows you to do that? 

Just to clarify the things. You meant a way that you could connect the QR code once and then it’d work for sometime or even forever on that same device without the need to do the QR code scan each time you try to login, is that right? 

Also, a question: does the Passkey you’ve been using have a fingerprint or faceID system or only the QR code? Because I believe it’d solve your problem but not sure yet. 

Let me know and thanks for your reply and feedbackComment 36: I don't have this issue on my Pixel 7 Pro. The phone needs to be connected to your computer via bluetooth for it to communicate with it, and once its communicated a prompt appears on my phone and it asks for my fingerprint to complete the login.

Did you add your phone as a ""passkey"" in the google security settings, or under ""security keys"". I believe the latter is just for 2FA instead of single sign on so maybe that is the issue? Maybe the issue is you are using the brave browser while I am using chrome?Comment 37: Ok, I got what you mean, thanks for the explanation bro. Let’s keep in touchComment 38: Can you an app password?Comment 39: I don’t wanna be an employee, always prefer work for myselfComment 40: That’s an example of, but not the definition of phishing. And I’m not sure how it would even be possible to share a passkey with an attacker.Comment 41: Not being able to “export” a passkey from a secure enclave makes it so user also can’t inadvertently send them to attackers. Huge upside with almost no downside.Comment 42: > I think requiring biometrics is a violation of privacy and the alternative (a PIN) is not secure enough. Therefore, the entire premise doesn't work.

Because why? Biometrics data is stored locally on a separate chip inaccessible by the OS
> A pin which is easy to guess and completely insecure. And earlier this week, it was also shown that the fingerprint biometrics of Windows Hello had been circumvented. Thus also not secure.

Yes because all those hackers can use MY pin for MY device on THEIR computer to access my accounts.

>Requiring someone to either hand over their biometrics or use an insecure device PIN is not progress. It will just mean being robbed involves robbers not just taking your phone, but your fingers as well. 

Who are you giving your biometrics? Certainly not Apple. Your windows Hello face is also not stored on MS's servers. [Also If you're targeted physically you're already screwed anyways.](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security) This is about online security

> Also, if I use a Windows Hello pin, this would require me to make a separate passkey if I happen to not be near my PC, so instead of ONE password for all devices, I know need at least 4 different passkeys to properly log into my accounts from anywhere I want to. That is not a practical solution.

It's not like you need to remember those 4 passkey in your mind. Also plenty of services (iCloud Keychain or password managers store them encrypted in the cloud.)Comment 43: What makes you think a PIN is easy to guess or insecure compared to a password? PINs on Windows Hello are alphanumeric they are not just 4 or 6 digit numbers like other PINs. These are effectively just password that works only a specific device. 

What is not practical about having multiple passkeys compared to having one password for all devices? The device with the passkey would still need to be unlocked either way but with the passkey you would not need to enter any password. You can say maybe the process of making them but that would be similar to setting up 2FA.Comment 44: You're welcome anytime. And yes I have tried to research this (even leave comments on websites and even emailed a editor of an article about this) and there is no answer to my specific issue unfortunately. 


And yes basically what I mean is this: since the passkey is now on my phone and ready to go I wish I could just go to my PC and once I log with my user name I just get a prompt instantly on my phone asking me if I'm trying to log in now? For which once I select yes it's me then it should authenticate and sign me in since the passkey is already on my phone. Before passkeys became a thing, I kinda had that option with 2FA set on my Google account. Google at the time, allowed someone to use phone prompts to sign in without having to enter a password at all or scan a QR code each and every time. I would just select it was me once I got the prompt on my phone, and sometimes it would ask me to use my screen lock or for me to unlock my phone to login in or it would have a number on the screen and I would have to select it on my phone to login. 



And I'll humbly admit this, I'm not sure if this is the reason I'm constantly getting the QR code prompt on my PC, but for my passkey I thought (I thought) I could just use my screen lock for my phone as a passkey since I don't have any biometrics set up on my phone. Ive been using a password on my phone for years now and I thought I could use that as a passkey to sign into my Google account.


I don't know if I'm just misunderstanding how passkeys work but I really just like the simplicity of using Google prompts on my phone to sign in with and not having to use my password or a QR code now or anything else (constantly) to login with on my PC.Comment 45: Thank you for trying to help me with this. Google finally fixed it so now those issues have been resolved. All I do now is just sign in and select the passkey option and then once the drop down section comes on my PC about which device I then just select my pixel and then it signs me in without scanning the QR code again.Comment 46: I understand that, but for passkeys, it's definitely not the way to go. 

I love passkeys as well, I have been following the subject since the release of Webauthn in 2018, and they are using the same principles as PGP, so it could have been done since years, but the main lack was the synchronisation. And that required the big techs to work together with FIDO Alliance as well to get a working solution.

If you develop a solution alone, without being FIDO compliant, I think that the support would be poor among the websites and it wouldn't be so usable. 

It would be better to work with the existing solution and improve it if you can :)Comment 47: That's the thing, passkeys are made so the risk of a user sharing it with an attacker is lowered to the minimum. And that's working pretty well as currently the only way is to share it via a password manager to a user that you trust and that you added as a user that can access some of your vault items

I understand why Apple do this for the average user, but I value having locally stored passkeys for security.Comment 10: Bitwarden doesn't support passkeys just yet, it's coming some time this month supposedly. However, for security, I'm not sure storing passkeys in an online vault is a good idea just yet.Comment 11: I really think your fears are unfounded. For one, it’s WAY more secure than passwords. They are encrypted exactly like all data.
1Password has a better security model than Apple in my opinion.  If you try to open 1Password with Face ID and it fails. It falls back to master password. It does not fall back to phones passcode. I think keychain does. Which means that a person would only need your phones passcode. With 1Password, they would need your master password - assuming iPhone Face ID does its job and fails for anyone but you.

As passkeys act as a password and second factor of authentication, a bad actor could technically get straight into my accounts. 

It's the same reason I choose not to store my passwords and TOTP in the same vault (despite Bitwarden supporting this).Comment 13: I understand. Keeppass local might be a better fit. 

If someone got into your vault it’s game over for everything.
That’s why 1Password does it best in my opinion. master password and secret key for ANY new device. Additionally, if someone got admin access to you PC, they can do anything anyway.

Some people go an extra step and store only partial password. When they login they add the extra character(s).  It’s overkill  imho.Comment 14: Personally, I duplicate my TOTP codes in 1Password and Microsoft Authenticator. Except for 1Password itself - which is only in MS Auth.

I do a lot of remote travel and need to have “backup” solutions in case I lose my phone.Comment 15: It's not necessarily game over if someone got into my vault as they'd have to breach my separate TOTP app in order to access my most vital accounts.

I store my google passkeys on the phone (keychain) and others in 1Password.Comment 7: Yes, exactly, I was hoping to use Enpass for passkeys and Bitwarden for my password manager, but Apple lock it down to iCloud Keychain + a third party unfortunately.Comment 8: Is Bitwarden or good enough for passkeys?Comment 9: Also, you can't create passkeys if iCloud Keychain syncing is turned off. I understand why Apple do this for the average user, but I value having locally stored passkeys for security.Comment 10: Bitwarden doesn't support passkeys just yet, it's coming some time this month supposedly. However, for security, I'm not sure storing passkeys in an online vault is a good idea just yet.Comment 11: I really think your fears are unfounded. For one, it’s WAY more secure than passwords. They are encrypted exactly like all data.
1Password has a better security model than Apple in my opinion.  If you try to open 1Password with Face ID and it fails. It falls back to master password. It does not fall back to phones passcode. I think keychain does. Which means that a person would only need your phones passcode. With 1Password, they would need your master password - assuming iPhone Face ID does its job and fails for anyone but you.

EDIT (12/13/23): looks like iOS 17.3 will introduce a “stolen phone” security feature to address this.Comment 12: It's more a case of if someone got into my vault, they'd have access to the public key of my passkeys.

As passkeys act as a password and second factor of authentication, a bad actor could technically get straight into my accounts. 

It's the same reason I choose not to store my passwords and TOTP in the same vault (despite Bitwarden supporting this).Comment 13: I understand. Keeppass local might be a better fit. 

If someone got into your vault it’s game over for everything.
That’s why 1Password does it best in my opinion. master password and secret key for ANY new device. Additionally, if someone got admin access to you PC, they can do anything anyway.

Some people go an extra step and store only partial password. When they login they add the extra character(s).  It’s overkill  imho.Comment 14: Personally, I duplicate my TOTP codes in 1Password and Microsoft Authenticator. Except for 1Password itself - which is only in MS Auth.

I do a lot of remote travel and need to have “backup” solutions in case I lose my phone.Comment 15: It's not necessarily game over if someone got into my vault as they'd have to breach my separate TOTP app in order to access my most vital accounts. It would be with Passkeys and if I stored TOTP in Bitwarden.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at Keeppass.Comment 16: Btw, some sites (NVIDIA.com) let you still have TOTP with code as an extra step to passkeys."

Also, 1Password falls back to master password if Face ID fails. It does NOT fall back to phone passcode. This is a good thing for security. So your trusted family member should have access to you master password or you put specific accounts in the shared vault. 
If you’re worried about security while you’re still alive (i e you don’t want to share) you can put this info in your will or emergency papers

Also, currently there are no sites or services that  have ONLY passkeys. They all, at least for now, still have a password. Also, account backup recovery options are still available like before.Comment 2: You have the same problems when it comes to passwords. Sure, passkey secrets aren’t as easily transmissible as passwords (which can simply be written down in a will or other location), but fundamentally, this isn’t an issue exclusive to passkeys.Comment 3: It seems to me that this would make it *more convenient* than passwords in the same situation. Instead of making sure that you have all of your passwords documented somewhere, you just have to have the passcode for your devices documented. That single passcode allows you to bypass biometrics. The biometrics are just for convenience and to keep someone from shoulder surfing. But if you give someone the code for your device or the master password for 1Password, etc., they don't need you.Comment 4: If you use Apple's iCloud Keychain to sync passkeys, their legacy contacts feature establishes a way for your family or trusted individuals to take ownership of your Apple ID in such an event.

This would grant them access to all saved passwords, 2fa codes, and passkeys owned by you. Individual companies and services may also have their own recovery methods.

Also, this issue isn't unique to passkeys.Comment 5: You can share passkeys with other people in certain instances. If someone has access to a device with the credentials they could use the passkeys on it depending on how they are stored.

Most accounts at this point still require a password as well and there are recovery mechanisms. 

What about accounts only protected by a password? One would still have to plan ahead if they want others to access the accounts after they are gone so it’s no different with passkeys really.Comment 6: You could create a passkey for an application tied to your AppleID, and then you could create another tied to someone else's AppleID/iPhone, for example.

*Strictly when it comes to the topic of recovery plans for passkey protected accounts*, there really isn't a huge diff between password auth and passkeys.  A passkey can be made just as tangible as a password, and can be kept pretty safe, as long as it's always held securely.

For example, you can create a few additional passkeys and enroll them as additional passkeys in every one of your passkey protected accounts.  If these passkeys are held in one or more physical security keys, the physical security keys can be put in a safe or safety deposit box.  The same types of instructions you mention that could be left with passwords, could be created for how to use these passkeys.  The instructions could include websites and the PIN numbers for each physical security key.  If someone somehow got access to just your safety deposit box, they would have no practical way to access the private keys on the physical security keys.  If they got access to just your instructions, they'd need to get access to your safety deposit box in order to access your accounts.

And this is how you could give your accounts a continuity plan without involving the services that these accounts are on.  Behind this, each of your accounts presently, and will always have account recovery steps that could be invoked if anything happened to you.  These can also be used to recover each of your accounts as well.  For example, most banks allow an executor access to accounts in order to distribute funds.  That sorta thing.Comment 14: Not necessarily if the business also allows users to register another strong credential (ie physical Security key) other than passkey although I haven't seen any yet that doesComment 15: Ah bummer. I did not realize that.

Still, you have options. Passwords + backup codes stored in a safe place is one option. Apps like 1Password have what's known as an Emergency Kit, which is a set of credentials anyone can use to access your 1Password account (and synced passkeys). You could do something similar with Bitwarden.

If you trust someone enough, you could create a passkey for one of their devices to grant them access to your primary accounts (Google, Apple, etc), which they could use for account recovery with other services.

Again, all things not unique to passkeys. It's good to think about this sort of thing and talk with your family about creating a plan.Comment 16: That is not correct. Since you mentioned mentioned Apple, they actually allow you to share passkeys via iCloud Keychain. You could also leave instructions on how to access your Apple devices and the passcode and then they could use your own device to use the passkeys stored in keychain. 

You could also create a passkey using a physical yubikey so that anyone that has access to that yubikey can use it. 
“YubiKeys can handle authentication through multiple means: two-factor, (and / or) multi-factor, and touch-to-sign. And with our latest iteration, the YubiKey 5 Series, our security keys even offer passwordless authentication using passkeys.”

https://www.yubico.com/resources/glossary/what-is-a-passkey/

If you have your passkeys stored in the password manager 1password, you could just leave the credentials for the password manager for someone and they can then use any passkeys stored in it if they have access to the account. 

Those are just some examples. I’m not sure where you are getting the idea that passkeys can’t be shared or can’t be accessible by others. There are options and you just have to plan for it.

Also, just to mention, there aren’t many, if any, sites that let you fully delete the password option to login yet after enabling a passkey. Passkeys are in their infancy and we could begin to see other options for sharing them.  Their design doesn’t inherently disallow giving others access to them.Comment 17: Technology doesn’t know when you’re dead to trigger a change in who is authorized. This isn’t a technology problem.

This really isn’t any different than with other authenticators like passwordsComment 18: I already have all the above in place. My question is specifically about passkeys. Many people will switch to passkeys not realizing the difficulty they are creating for their future caretakers and heirs.Comment 19: So my caretaker would be able to use my iPhone and authenticate as me to use my passkeys?  I thought passkeys usually require some form of biometric authentication. 

I use 1Password and like your solution. I just want to ensure the user will not need to biometrically authenticate as me if they need to access my 1Password account from their own PC. For instance if my financial caretaker were in another location (if I were in a hospital or nursing home). Also, I wouldn’t want them to have access until my incapacity is triggered (when their authority kicks in).  So sharing my passkeys beforehand is not an option.Comment 20: However, you can actually share passwords in your will. 
No such luck with passkeys. Your family won't be able to unlock the biometrics even if they have all your devices.Comment 21: Again, not really. If you don’t share the passwords to any of your accounts, your surviving family would have the same problem.

Passkeys don’t have a unique problem here. You’re talking about credential sharing and/or account recovery, which is something you can accomplish regardless if you use passwords or passkeys.

If you don’t talk with them and have a plan in place, they’re going to have difficulty accessing your important accounts.Comment 22: Biometrics aren’t tied to the passkeys, it’s just that some OSes will use biometrics to authenticate in order to access the passkeys.

1Password doesn’t require biometrics in order to access the passkeys, just the 1Password master password is needed. I just tested that on my iPhone, it falls back to the 1password password if Face ID fails and the passkey goes through. 

So for 1password they would just need your 1password master password (and your 1password secret key if you wanted them to use it on a device that wasn’t already logged into your 1password account). 

I’ll have to test iCloud Keychain on the iPhone but I’m pretty sure on my Mac you can use the passkeys in iCloud Keychain just with the Mac user password. At least that’s what I recall, I’d have to test that again.Comment 23: I have a written plan with instructions on how to access all my passwords in place. I am just concerned with them not being able to use my passkeys due to them not being able to authenticate as me.Comment 24: This is so helpful. Exactly the info I was looking for. Thank you. I hate being downvoted for trying to get this important question sorted out.Comment 25: If you rely on Biometrics, you have a larger challenge. Fortunately, PIN CODES can be shared.Comment 26: Why? If password + backup codes are setup, nothing about passkeys would prevent them from accessing those accounts. If you eventually go passwordless, the same account recovery steps would apply as if you forgot a password. You can also assign hardware security keys to your accounts and store them in a safe place, giving one more method of authentication in addition to sharing passkeys.

That’s why having a plan in place helps. It’s a good idea to revisit that plan every so often and ensure that it’s current and still works.

Once again, this problem is not unique to passkeys nor do passkeys create additional problems here.Comment 27: Passkeys are never the only way to sign into an account. All websites that offer a passkey give you options. They also allow you to log in with a regular password, such as in case you are using a computer that doesn’t have Face ID or Touch ID.

I am specifically concerned with passkeys (with no fallback passwords). Because I don’t want to share my passkeys until I am incapacitated (or have died) as my trustee and executor is not family, but a hired trustee.  When this legal trigger goes in effect, they would follow my instructions to access my accounts to pay my bills (or my estate’s bills). 

Can I create multiple Yubikeys that allow access to my passkeys and for which I could instruct my caretaker to access upon my incapacity or death?Comment 30: According to Security Now podcast episode 953, GitHub disables all other forms of authentication upon enabling passkeys.  https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-953-Notes.pdfComment 31: Depends on what you use to sync passkeys, but you could setup some Yubikeys to store passkeys for your primary accounts (like email for account recovery), as well as to help access passkeys for other sites that are synced to another device such as Android/Apple, or with a password manager like 1Password or Bitwarden.

With Google passkeys work like a charm in my experience.   
What might be an option is to try this website : https://webauth 

And try it with 1Password. It should work. This website is a test website for passkeys.Comment 9: >https://webauth

2) I still have a Windows 7 machine that I'm gradually moving things off of, but sometimes I still need to sign in to things on it. Everything I've seen about passkeys requires at least Win10.

I do have a password manager with a strong password, so I can always sign in to the web-based version of that to get info at need.

If you're not already using 2 step authentication with TOTP codes, you're vulnerable to your account being brute forced. If you're using TOTP codes right now, not having your phone would be equally a problem for you.

Your recovery options are the same regardless if you use passkeys or passwords. Security keys, backup codes, alternate email addresses, phone number, etc.

My pixel 7 fingerprint thing pretty much doesn't work at all.  I've re-done it twice and I've given up.   I grew a beard last winter.  Face recognition didn't handle it well (as in ""that's not you"").  Face recognition doesn't work without lots of light.  In the evenings, I end up using that 4-digit code to get into my Pixel probably 95 percent of the time. 

I don't at all trust biometrics.  With what AI can do with voices and videos, I'm just kind of expecting news stories about how AI can completely circumvent the biometrics Passkey is using and depending on. 

I use Yubikeys.  I have great confidence in those.  And I have confidence in my 25-character passwords (plus or minus) stored in Bitwarden (which is protected with my Yubikey). 

This passkeys thing seems to have thrown out the ""multi"" part of multi-factor (because novices keep using Password123 on all their accounts???).  They're betting all security on face recognition???  Seriously?

Yubikeys are generally very easy, though.  With Bitwarden, for example, I have my big-ish passphrase Bitwarden requires.  And if I enter that ok, it says ""ok, insert your yubikey into the USB port and push the little button on the key""  I do that and I'm in. 

And I can use Bitwarden such that it won't require the Yubikey each time I unlock my ""vault"" of passwords with my master password.  Or I can work such that it always asks me for my Yubikey on my device.  But the ""bad guys"" will always be asked and they won't have it. 

Biometrics just aren't good.  When I pass, I'd like my wife to be able to go into my e-mail and other accounts.  With biometrics, I would imagine that that's not going to be supported.   With Yubikeys, it's easy.

Right now, Google has no way for you to go completely passwordless yet. Passkeys are the default way to log in, but you still are required to have a password.

That said, your account should be protected as long as you use a unique password for each site plus have 2-step authentication enabled. In the future, I imagine they will allow you to remove your password from your account entirely like Microsoft has.

You can create a passkey on multiple devices you own if you wish to authenticate directly on your PC. Sign into your Google account, and in your security settings, there is an option for you to create a new passkey on that PC. You'll then be able to authenticate directly using your PC (pin, fingerprint, face scanner, whatever you have) and not rely on your phone.

Chrome on Desktop does not sync passkeys at the moment. It relies on the underlaying OS support. At this time, Windows does not sync passkeys either, meaning you'll need to create a new passkey on each Windows PC you own if you do not wish to require your phone each time. You can revoke passkeys on old devices at any time through your Google account, as well.

You can also use a password manager like 1Password or soon Bitwarden to store and sync your passkeys on any device if you'd prefer that approach.

Fwiw, Apple has the most cohesive passkey implementation built in. A passkey created on any of your Apple devices will automatically sync to all others (phone to mac, for example). With the updated iCloud Password extension for Chrome, you can even access those passkeys in other browsers as well on the Mac. This requires you to be all in on Apple, of course.Comment 9: Thank you for letting me know this. I was aware of all that was involved with this.

Let’s take your phone for example. In order to use passkeys, you’d first have to enter your passcode at least once to enable FaceId/touchID. After that, passkey will use biometric.

If you use a passkey managed with 1Password, you have some protection. When you use faceID to open your vault, but it fails to recognize your face, it falls back to requiring your master password.

Regardless, people should protect their device PIns/passcodes just like you do with debit card PIN.Comment 6: For sure. I believe that too. I might have phrased my post in a bad way. I'm all for passkeys, like right now if possible, I'm just doubting or at least wondering about the security we put in place to protect them.

For example in windows, when you enable windows hello, you **must** have a PIN in addition to whatever biometric or hardware security key (like yubikee I guess) you have.

And that's what I'm afraid of, because that's the ""weakest link"" in the new passkey chain.Comment 7: That's exactly my issue - entering the passcode (which is the apple equivalent afaik of the PIN on windows or android).

Like after rebooting phone. Passcode/pin is not  weak at all, but you must not share it or let people see you enter it.

A six digit PIN where the phone limits the number of tries and can even slow you down on successive failures is actually VERY secure - as long as you protect the passcode.

In fact it’s more secure than Face ID / Touch ID in that law enforcement can not force you to enter your passcode, but they can force you to use your biometric - at least in America 

Still this is separate from passkeys. Passkeys are MUCH better than passwords in terms of mitigating the largest amounts of attack vectors:

1. password reuse, 
2. Websites hacked that did not practicing security best practices and storing username and password in the clear or weakly
3. Social engineering and phishing
4. Poor password strength

And more.

4. Poor password strength

And more.

You can have separate passkeys for each device and even store passkeys on yubikeys for ultimate security (although more effort)."

* Passkeys are essentially immune to being phished as no secrets are typed into a text field anywhere (a username should not be considered a secret, and depending on the implementation of the service, might not even be necessary to be provided).
* Passkeys are much stronger against MITM attacks as the browser (or other application) and OS play a role in determining the authenticity of the service or website in question.

>Currently, YubiKeys can store a maximum of 25 passkeys. We are evaluating increasing this in the future because of the likely increase in fully passwordless experiences across the web that require them.

If Passkeys really take off, then the Yubikey is not going to be your answer.Comment 10: The only way I can get that to work is using Chrome. Firefox won't do it, and Apple doesn't give the option.

But that leads to a similar problem.  Now I have to have my Yubikey with me. And I need to set up multiple Yubikeys on each site. I can't get my passkeys off the Yubikey, so if I lose the Yubikey, I'm screwed.

There's also the issue of Yubikeys being limited to only 25 passkeys. I really hope they fix that with a new Yubikey 6.Comment 11: I want them in my local ecosystem in a generic format usable by any software. I don't wan to store them in an ecosystem where my account might somehow get banned, such as Google, Apple or a paid password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc).

Passkeys may be phishing resistant. But websites that don't allow you to turn off all methods of authentication are NOT phishing resistant.

And if I am going to just use a passkey, I need to be able to back it up in a way that I can still get to it if I lose access to online accounts that store them and only have a local copy.Comment 12: So, Keepass supports Passkeys now? When did that happen.Comment 13: Checked the website. Though Strongbox does do Passkeys now, there is no export or import. And it sounds like the passkeys are NOT part of the the Keepass database. It's also only available in the iOS app.

I'll wait for the export and import feature and MacOS support. Without it, it's just another vendor lock-in.Comment 14: Thing is most people tend to carry one phone with them, and in general they stick with whatever platform they choose. The ecosystem itself doesn’t matter as much since passkeys can be used by the users phone to authenticate a machine without storing a new passkey on it.

Presumably passkey transport is something that’s being worked on. The entire point of passkeys is that they _can’t_ be easily exportable, that defeats the main security benefit of them. That said, people do need to be able to move them between systems they own, and figuring out how to do that securely is going to be challenging.

For now, it’s honestly not that difficult to create one passkey for each ecosystem you use if you wish, and never worry about it again.Comment 15: [deleted]Comment 16: Perhaps, but can’t completely dismiss that as a longer term solution if they do expand that number as they state they are evaluating. 

With the current state of passkey adoption, the 25 passkey limit isn’t too much of an issue.Comment 17: I was thinking this morning there are a lot of accounts I have where passkeys would just be overkill. I don’t need Fort Knox grade security for my Netflix account or some forum accounts I rarely use. I would want to use them for my Reddit account since someone could take over my account and impersonate me. Im sure streaming services would love it if everyone used passkeys since password sharing would be a thing of the past, but they’re are definitely accounts where I will still want to use a simple password I can easily share because hacking is a non issue. 
I like third party solutions like 1Password for passkeys, as long as I’m not using a passkey for 1Password itself. Even in a catastrophic situation where I lose all my devices I can still get to my passkeys with information that is stored in my brain (password), although the secret key would have to be stored off site in a secure location.Comment 18: Sounds like Passkeys aren’t a good fit for you, then.Comment 19: Some KeePass apps like Strongbox yes, I tested it and works very good.Comment 20: They are defenatly part of the DB. As far as I know they are planning also export. But as I can easily move,backup,etc... my DB file I do not see why I would need export, except maybe migration to another app different then KeePass.

But overall this is best KeePass app that I have ever used.

The cons are mainly that it works only on iphone and Mac and also you need paid subscription for some features like open with PIN and face recognition.Comment 21: Well that's literally not the entire point of passkeys. The point of passkeys is to have an easily accessible way to use FIDO authentication and have non-phishable credentials. People aren't having their accounts compromised because they can export their password vaults. Allowing people to export their passkeys isn't some crazy difficult issue to solve. It's a conscious decision that they're not working on.
And sure, it's not that hard to set them up on multiple devices, but most users won't go through that process multiple times when they can just do what they've always done, since they'll have to enter their password to set it up anyway. It's just another pointless barrier that could be easily removed if vendors didn't prioritize lock in. Small barriers keep a massive portion of people from doing things. That's why people use the same short password for everything when they could easily use a password manager that would make their life easier and more secureComment 22: You're missing the point.

Right now there is NO way to move your passkeys anywhere. So, if I create passkeys on 25 sites and save them in iCloud keychain, that's great. But then I decide to move to Android.  I can't move those passkeys to Google. I need to go into all those sites and create new passkeys and revoke the old ones.

Even if you use a cross-platform solution such as 1Password.  Great. Now you can change phones.  You can change from Mac to Windows.  Know what you can't do?  You can't get rid of 1Password and switch to Bitwarden without revoking all your passkeys and then creating all new ones in Bitwarden.

Even if you use a ""local only"" solution such as Strongbox on the Mac, you still can't export your passkeys and move them. They're forever trapped in Strongbox.

The Passkeys spec doesn't have anything in it about exporting or moving your keys. I had email support exchanges with 1Password about this. They WANT TO be able to allow you to export your passkeys. But that's not part of the spec. So, they're working with the FIDO alliance to add it to the spec and then they plan to add it to 1Password.

Until that happens, Passkeys are a great vendor lock-in.  You can't switch from Chrome to Firefox, because all your passkeys are trapped in Chrome. Can't switch from Android to iPhone because Google has all your passkeys.

Now, people like us on the geekier level will be able to create new passkeys and revoke the old ones. But for the average America, it might as well be vendor lock in. For them you visit a site and click on the ""Passkey"" button and they just magically login to a site.Comment 23: If the account has payment information saved, you want Fort Knox level of security. Forum accounts, probably not. Netflix, definitely yes.Comment 24: Obviously not.

They're a good way to get vendor lock-in. I think that's why Apple, Google and everyone else hopped on board as fast as they could. They saw the vendor lock-in potential.

It feels like a half-ass solution to me.Comment 25: I have not read about Keepass or KeepassXC adding Passkeys support. I'm curious if I could take my Strongbox DB and open it in Keepass or KeepassXC and use the Passkeys in it.Comment 26: >Allowing people to export their passkeys isn't some crazy difficult issue to solve. It's a conscious decision that they're not working on.

The FIDO Alliance literally is [working on passkey portability](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/with-ios-17-and-macos-sonoma-passkeys-coming-to-apple-id-login/). Both Google and Apple have pledged support for this according to CNET.Comment 27: I’m not totally sure this addresses your complaint, but recently with Amazon I created a few passkeys. One is stored in 1Password behind my master password, the other is stored on a physical security key. I think I even have a third one on iCloud Keychain. This doesn’t in any way solve your main complaint, but it does make it less painful should you ditch a particular ecosystem.Comment 28: I'm not sure I agree with this. What can someone who hacks into a streaming service  account do? They could upgrade my account I suppose. Is there a scenario I'm not thinking of?Comment 29: One can easily create Passkeys than span different ecosystems, that’s the exact opposite of vendor lock-in. Frankly I’ve found it easier to create Passkeys in multiple ecosystems than to move my contacts or photos. 

Most users already trust either Google or Apple with their passwords through built-in password auto-fill, Passkeys just strengthen that authentication. 

Just because it doesn’t fit your niche, less secure use case doesn’t make it half ass.Comment 30: What you are saying makes a lot of sense to be honest, in my opinion we need a decentralized passkey that’s not controlled by any company as Google, Apple and other companies are clearly trying to doComment 31: Haven't tried this, but I am pretty sure that you will be able to see the passkey entry, but not use it in websites as they do not support passkeys yet.Comment 32: there is a pull request in KeepassXC github with a passkey implementation. Keepassium and Strongbox already are up about this and there are discussions about a pattern.Comment 33: There's nothing stopping passkeys portability to already be implemented. Individual devs have already made projects that provide it within the passkeys manager. It's not like the standard prohibits it.
It seems like FIDO is just trying to create a workaround for the issues the big players have created. And while I love individual projects that solve problems that shouldn't have existed, it doesn't help for mass adoption. It's great that FIDO is trying to hold the hands of these massive companies that could have easily solved the ""issue"" of portability, as if they just don't know how to write code or something. It's still a fumble of a rollout. And until passkeys can be easily shared across ecosystems, people just aren't going to put in the work.Comment 34: Well, there is always the possibility they could get your payment information. If you have a saved credit card with Netflix, they may be able to get access to that.

And it's not really hacking your account.  It's someone hacking Netflix and exfiltrating the data of millions of customers.Comment 35: There is a thread in the 1Password discussion forums about this.  1 Password says they're working with the FIDO Alliance to add a secure way to export and import passkeys to the spec.

I'm sure they'll get there one day. But the question is, will Apple. Google and other large companies support it?

And then we have the ""weakest link"" problem. If a site won't let you go ""all passkey"" and delete your password permanently, then all the passkey is doing is making it a lot easier to login to a website.Comment 36: I'll experiment with this when it's added to the MacOS version. Thanks for letting me know about it.","Every piece of software that supports passkeys locks them away, so I can never access them. This is pretty unacceptable.

They're a good way to get vendor lock-in. I think that's why Apple, Google and everyone else hopped on board as fast as they could. They saw the vendor lock-in potential.

It feels like a half-ass solution to me.Comment 25: I have not read about Keepass or KeepassXC adding Passkeys support.

The FIDO Alliance literally is [working on passkey portability](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/with-ios-17-and-macos-sonoma-passkeys-coming-to-apple-id-login/). Both Google and Apple have pledged support for this according to CNET.Comment 27: I’m not totally sure this addresses your complaint, but recently with Amazon I created a few passkeys. One is stored in 1Password behind my master password, the other is stored on a physical security key. I think I even have a third one on iCloud Keychain. This doesn’t in any way solve your main complaint, but it does make it less painful should you ditch a particular ecosystem.Comment 28: I'm not sure I agree with this. What can someone who hacks into a streaming service  account do? They could upgrade my account I suppose. Is there a scenario I'm not thinking of?Comment 29: One can easily create Passkeys than span different ecosystems, that’s the exact opposite of vendor lock-in. Frankly I’ve found it easier to create Passkeys in multiple ecosystems than to move my contacts or photos. 

Most users already trust either Google or Apple with their passwords through built-in password auto-fill, Passkeys just strengthen that authentication. 

Just because it doesn’t fit your niche, less secure use case doesn’t make it half ass.Comment 30: What you are saying makes a lot of sense to be honest, in my opinion we need a decentralized passkey that’s not controlled by any company as Google, Apple and other companies are clearly trying to doComment 31: Haven't tried this, but I am pretty sure that you will be able to see the passkey entry, but not use it in websites as they do not support passkeys yet.Comment 32: there is a pull request in KeepassXC github with a passkey implementation. Keepassium and Strongbox already are up about this and there are discussions about a pattern.Comment 33: There's nothing stopping passkeys portability to already be implemented. Individual devs have already made projects that provide it within the passkeys manager. It's not like the standard prohibits it.
It seems like FIDO is just trying to create a workaround for the issues the big players have created. And while I love individual projects that solve problems that shouldn't have existed, it doesn't help for mass adoption. It's great that FIDO is trying to hold the hands of these massive companies that could have easily solved the ""issue"" of portability, as if they just don't know how to write code or something. It's still a fumble of a rollout. And until passkeys can be easily shared across ecosystems, people just aren't going to put in the work.Comment 34: Well, there is always the possibility they could get your payment information. If you have a saved credit card with Netflix, they may be able to get access to that.

And it's not really hacking your account.  It's someone hacking Netflix and exfiltrating the data of millions of customers.Comment 35: There is a thread in the 1Password discussion forums about this.  1 Password says they're working with the FIDO Alliance to add a secure way to export and import passkeys to the spec.

I'm sure they'll get there one day. But the question is, will Apple. Google and other large companies support it?

And then we have the ""weakest link"" problem. If a site won't let you go ""all passkey"" and delete your password permanently, then all the passkey is doing is making it a lot easier to login to a website.Comment 36: I'll experiment with this when it's added to the MacOS version. Thanks for letting me know about it."
16zg723,Passkeys on shared devices in a way that might work,"My understanding of the way Passkeys work is they tie login credentials to a device's biometrics, like fingerprints or facial recognition. When setting up a passkey, the user provides biometrics to verify their identity. Then when logging in, all they need to do is select the passkey and the service is notified they have been biometrically authenticated on that device.

Makes sense, but in shared device situations, there are problems. The typical one I see mentioned is I set up passkeys on my tablet using my biometrics. Then when I leave the tablet unlocked, a family member tries to access one of my accounts, and the passkey will be suggested for automatic login since the device itself has already been unlocked.

The way it actually should work is that when the passkey is selected and used for login, the passkey provider (Apple Keychain, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.) should require re-authentication via biometrics before granting access.

Requiring biometrics on use would add an extra layer of security by ensuring the actual user is present. It's a minimal inconvenience to provide fingerprints/facial scan again.

16xumop,Passkeys in the context of WebAuthn resident keys and non-resident keys,"Hi,

I recently stumbled across [this blog post](https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/2023-02-02-how-hype-will-turn-your-security-key-into-junk/) criticizing some decisions of the FIDO working group regarding **resident keys (discoverable credentials)** and **non-resident keys (non-discoverable credentials)** in the context of passkeys.

After also having worked in the WebAuthn / passkeys field for quite some time and answering many developer questions around the settings, I summarized my findings to **help other developers when setting up a WebAuthn server for their use case**.

[**Read blog post**](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-resident-key-discoverable-credentials-passkeys)

Hope it helps some folks. What are your experiences when setting up a WebAuthn server and working with WebAuthn server options?",vdelitz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/16xumop/passkeys_in_the_context_of_webauthn_resident_keys/,,,"Comment 1: Interesting! Thanks for sharing.

Edit 1 : 

I have red the article and two things came to mind:

1. Imho passkeys are additional to security keys. In the case of Apple I can imagine that users authenticate themselves on a new device using the a Yubikey/Nitrokey/Any other brand. And after that they use the Passkeys stored in the iCloud Keychain to authenticate them on any given website.
2. Wouldn’t it be a solution to manufacture a Yubikey/Nitrokey with a 1000 slots for discoverable credentials? Or would that be too expensive?

Edit 2 : 

Another option would be to allways use discoverable credentials with passkeys and allways non-discoverable credentials with Yubikeys/Nitrokeys. That way the server can be confident if a security key or a password manager is used. And in the case of a lost security key it’s pretty useless if found. Such a security key can be used together with a password manager using either passwords or passkeys. Since the password manager fills in the username and the Yubikey/Nitrokey is only doing what’s it supposed to be doing which is 2FA.Comment 2: > After also having worked in the WebAuthn / passkeys field for quite some time and answering many developer questions around the settings, I summarized my findings to help other developers when setting up a WebAuthn server for their use case.

And you got it completely wrong. Let's see exactly how badly (spoiler: nearly everything in your post is based on incorrect information.)

---

Your post says,

> if a user wants to add multiple non-resident keys to their account, it’s not possible to tell which of the stored credential IDs belongs to the provided user handle without providing more information. [..] The problem now is that there are two credential IDs associated with the one email address of the user. In the next login attempt, when the user provides their email address, the relying party does not know which credential ID to send back to the user’s device for authentication. However, the right credential ID is needed to derive the private key.

**This is completely wrong.** What *actually* happens is that the RP looks up *ALL* enrolled non-discoverable credential IDs and includes them in the `allowCredentials` sequence, as defined in the [WebAuthn standard §5.5 Options for Assertion Generation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#dom-publickeycredentialrequestoptions-allowcredentials).

**Since your entire blog article is predicated on this misinformation, all of your following conclusions are completely wrong!** A user who has enrolled 2 (or more) non-discoverable will be able to complete the multi-step login process with *ANY* of the authenticators, *even if multiple are connected at once.*

---

Let's see how much this invalidates your remaining claims:

> The reason for this implementation and behavior of non-resident keys is that non-resident keys were introduced in a time when WebAuthn was primarily used as a second factor in 2FA processes. Most of the times, users provided their user handle and password as first factor. Then, they used one hardware security key (e.g. YubiKey) as second factor.

**Nonsense.** It's been commonplace for years that MFA (aka 2FA, but any *multiple* factor enrollment / login process) has *multiple* options. For example, pre-FIDO users might have enrolled both a TOTP and their mobile phone via SMS (or phone call) for tokens: they can *pick either one.*

FIDO works the same way here, *including with non-discovearble* credentials! You completely miss this point, but for a YubiKey (or any FIDO-compliant device) one can enroll multiple credentials, provided of course the service permits it; this is *highly desirable* so that a backup can exist in case of loss, damage, or theft of one of them, and allows users more flexibility in removing less-secure forms of MFA (SMS in particular.)

> In resident-key scenarios, the user simply presents their authenticator, and the relying party can pull up the necessary credentials from the device itself (no credential ID and thus no user handle needs to be provided by the user). Non-resident keys lack this simplicity, as each login attempt must be accompanied by the specific credential ID, which the relying party must supply or the user must select.

**This is mostly incorrect.** The **user** does **NOT** ""select"" the credential ID (regardless if the RP is sending 1 or 10 `allowCredentials` in the list per the aforementioned WebAuthn standard.) In fact, the user doesn't even *see* the credential ID.

What really happens when multiple enrolled FIDO non-discoverable credentials is that *every connected device* will prompt for User-Presence, and the user may pick *any* connected device. You go on to double-down on this claim a moment later:

> The core challenge for developers and product managers is managing multiple credential IDs efficiently and ensuring a user-friendly experience. The risk lies in complicating the authentication process because users need to select the right credential ID manually, potentially eroding the user experience and nullifying the convenience passkeys typically offer.

**This is even more wrong.** The user **does not ""select the right credential ID manually""** as you claim! They simply touch their FIDO token. **That's it: touch the device.** The user doesn't need to know a thing about Credential IDs or choosing a token before the login attempt: none of that.

You then go on to **fail to understand this and talk about a made-up series of failure modes that don't exist in reality:**

> [#1]. Try Every Stored Credential ID One by One: This is a rather theoretical option as manually trying all stored credential IDs on the authenticator causes a really bad user experience, because users would potentially see many errors until the right one matches.

**Nope.** What really happens is that **EVERY** enrolled credential is supplied. See the link above to the WebAuthn stnadard where it clearly says the `allowCredentials` is a *sequence* of `PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor` objects. A sequence, if you weren't aware, is a **list** -- many of them can be supplied. A user that has enrolled 6 FIDO tokens gets **all 6 of them back**.

Then the *browser* is free to **try them all** and does so **without any user interaction** -- failures here **are not visible to the user** which you go on to claim is the source of a ""really bad user experience."" It seems as though you haven't actually tried this, because you'd clearly know this isn't the case if you had.

> [#2]. Users Provide the Correct Credential ID Upfront: Besides suppling the user handle, the user also sends the right credential ID along, which is also very bad user experience, as managing the random credential ID is complex.

**Absolute rubbish.** This is never how WebAuthn was designed to work, and no workflow operates this way. You're just making things up to scare people aware from non-discoverable credentials, or honestly believe that making things up makes you an ""expert"" in the field. Ugh.

> [#3]. Only Allow One Non-Resident Key Per Account [..] [#4]. Implement Advanced Device Management [..]

**Nope. Not necessary.** (How do I know? Because I've done it, on demo enrollment services: stay tuned and I show the OP and all readers how in a moment!)

> Users Manually Choose The Right Non-Resident Key: From all presented options, this is the most viable one. It still introduces friction as users need to provide names for each non-resident key, so that they later do not need to decide based on a cryptic credential ID. Instead, users can then select the non-resident key based on a human understandable name.

**This is all very wrong.** That's not how this works at all during authentication time. Even with 2 (or more, could easily be 6 or 10) enrolled non-discoverable credentials, they appear in the `allowCredentials` sequence (list.) **Users do not pick which one to use in advance**, and they further **do not need to select the name to use them;** this applies **even if multiple FIDO tokens are plugged in!**

---

The ""recommendations"" from Corbado, at least *this* particular writeup, are **downright bad for user experience!** No one should follow these recommendations: **Corbado and Vincent's information is creating a downright hostile user-experience here!**

> For developers tasked with implementing applications that should be able to handle multiple non-resident keys per account, we recommend the following (in case only supporting resident keys or maximum having one non-resident key is no viable option): 1. Let User Manually Choose the Right Non-Resident Key:

**This is completely unnecessary.** Just send the proper response with the **sequence** (list) of `allowCredential` which contain the non-resident credential IDs. The browser will allow *any* connected token to be activated, and so long as the user activates *any* token with a matching credential, the login will succeed.

Obviously this won't work if a user has 2 tokens connected and has only enrolled one of them (but this doesn't work with a discoverable token in a no-username login situation either, so claiming that it's somehow better for UX is equally nonsense.)

> Understanding the behavior of non-resident keys within passkeys and adopting recommended best practices can help maintain the security and user experience that passkeys promise.

Well, here we get to the real crux of the issue. **Corbado is seemingly here to shill discovearble FIDO tokens, and is apparently willing to promote misinformation to do it.** The alternative is that the self-described ""passionate authentication expert and founder of Corbado"" has absolutely no clue how WebAuthn works. At best this article is completely misguided, and at worst, Corbado's founder is actively spreading misinformation to further their own ""Passkeys as a Service"" business.

---

So how can **I back up my claims?** Easy: **Try it yourself!**

1. Register a new user on the [Yubico Playground](https://demo.yubico.com/playground).
2. Once logged into the new account, click 'Add Security Key' (near the top,) and do **not** check the 'Enable Passwordless login' (leaving unchecked will create a *non-discoverable* credential)
3. Complete the WebAuthn enrollment ceremony
4. Insert a *different* FIDO token, and repeat steps 2 to 3, enrolling the *second* authenticator ^({either swap the tokens, or leave both connected but tap the 2nd one})
5. Optionally, create recovery codes (usually recommended for ""real world"" services, but for a demo users can skip it if not wanting to be as realistic; same applies to alternate, non-FIDO MFA methods.)
6. Click the 'Sign Out', to log out of the demo service
7. Now **plug both FIDO authenticator tokens in** -- this is the part that the referenced Corbado blog *claims is very hard for users.* I'm going to show that is *complete and utter nonsense*
8. Sign in again, using the username & password
9. When both FIDO tokens are present in the machine, **they both will flash, and users can touch either one.**

^(Edit: formatting)Comment 3: Your bit about non-resident keys isn't entirely accurate: ""This means either the user can only have one non-resident key per Relying Party or needs to decide beforehand, which non-resident key should be used.""

Every major deployment of NRKs (aka fido1 security keys) supports multiple keys per user. The key IDs (which are the wrapped keys) are provided in `publicKey.allowCredentials[].id`, and `allowCredentials` is a list. As an RP, you just provide the full list of key IDs associated with the user, the browser checks which one(s) are actually available, and only asks the user to use one of them.Comment 4: Hey u/Jybodi,  
  
Thank you for your detailed response, and I appreciate your constructive feedback.

I apologize for any confusion that this article may have caused. Our intention was never to mislead anyone, and I must admit that our original intention and explanations in the article were not specific enough. Consequently, I have completely rewritten it to hopefully make things clearer.

Our initial goal was to provide a way to help users select the appropriate YubiKey with an empty / non-complete allowCredential. This aim may have inadvertently led us down an incorrect path. To clarify, our intention was not to select a credential ID per se, but rather to suggest a usage like “use YubiKey A” and then proceed with the assertion. I apologize for this confusion.

We have since revised the article to make it clear that, in the case of non-resident keys, you should set allowCredentials and allow the browser to manage the rest.

Furthermore, it was not our intention to discredit non-resident keys, such as YubiKeys. We strongly believe in their use, particularly for internal authentication purposes among employees, e.g. including for AWS and SSH access, where we also utilize them internally. However, we recognize that, for non-technical external customers, passkeys might be more appropriate.

Thanks for your feedback! If you would like to provide any of your social profile URLs, I would be happy to credit you in the article.Comment 5: You're right - valid point and sorry for not being clear enough in this point. I corrected it to: ""This means the user needs to manually select in an operating system / browser modal which non-resident key should be used.""Comment 6: > I corrected it to: ""This means the user needs to manually select in an operating system / browser modal which non-resident key should be used.""

Your correction remains wrong. There's no selection required in a modal: the user simply taps the desired FIDO token and the browser uses that. See the workflow at the end of my top-level reply.

If you're serious about fixing your misinformation, you effectively need to retract the entire claim you make in this blog post.","Hi,

**Nope. Not necessary.** (How do I know? Because I've done it, on demo enrollment services: stay tuned and I show the OP and all readers how in a moment!)

> Users Manually Choose The Right Non-Resident Key: From all presented options, this is the most viable one. It still introduces friction as users need to provide names for each non-resident key, so that they later do not need to decide based on a cryptic credential ID. Instead, users can then select the non-resident key based on a human understandable name.

**This is all very wrong.** That's not how this works at all during authentication time. Even with 2 (or more, could easily be 6 or 10) enrolled non-discoverable credentials, they appear in the `allowCredentials` sequence (list.) **Users do not pick which one to use in advance**, and they further **do not need to select the name to use them;** this applies **even if multiple FIDO tokens are plugged in!**

---

The ""recommendations"" from Corbado, at least *this* particular writeup, are **downright bad for user experience!** No one should follow these recommendations: **Corbado and Vincent's information is creating a downright hostile user-experience here!**

> For developers tasked with implementing applications that should be able to handle multiple non-resident keys per account, we recommend the following (in case only supporting resident keys or maximum having one non-resident key is no viable option): 1. Let User Manually Choose the Right Non-Resident Key:

**This is completely unnecessary.** Just send the proper response with the **sequence** (list) of `allowCredential` which contain the non-resident credential IDs. The browser will allow *any* connected token to be activated, and so long as the user activates *any* token with a matching credential, the login will succeed.

Obviously this won't work if a user has 2 tokens connected and has only enrolled one of them (but this doesn't work with a discoverable token in a no-username login situation either, so claiming that it's somehow better for UX is equally nonsense.)

> Understanding the behavior of non-resident keys within passkeys and adopting recommended best practices can help maintain the security and user experience that passkeys promise.

Well, here we get to the real crux of the issue. **Corbado is seemingly here to shill discovearble FIDO tokens, and is apparently willing to promote misinformation to do it.** The alternative is that the self-described ""passionate authentication expert and founder of Corbado"" has absolutely no clue how WebAuthn works. At best this article is completely misguided, and at worst, Corbado's founder is actively spreading misinformation to further their own ""Passkeys as a Service"" business.

So how can **I back up my claims?** Easy: **Try it yourself!**

1. Register a new user on the [Yubico Playground](https://demo.yubico.com/playground).
2. Once logged into the new account, click 'Add Security Key' (near the top,) and do **not** check the 'Enable Passwordless login' (leaving unchecked will create a *non-discoverable* credential)
3. Complete the WebAuthn enrollment ceremony
4. Insert a *different* FIDO token, and repeat steps 2 to 3, enrolling the *second* authenticator ^({either swap the tokens, or leave both connected but tap the 2nd one})
5. Optionally, create recovery codes (usually recommended for ""real world"" services, but for a demo users can skip it if not wanting to be as realistic; same applies to alternate, non-FIDO MFA methods.)
6. Click the 'Sign Out', to log out of the demo service
7. Now **plug both FIDO authenticator tokens in** -- this is the part that the referenced Corbado blog *claims is very hard for users.* I'm going to show that is *complete and utter nonsense*
8. Sign in again, using the username & password
9. When both FIDO tokens are present in the machine, **they both will flash, and users can touch either one.**

^(Edit: formatting)Comment 3: Your bit about non-resident keys isn't entirely accurate: ""This means either the user can only have one non-resident key per Relying Party or needs to decide beforehand, which non-resident key should be used.""

Every major deployment of NRKs (aka fido1 security keys) supports multiple keys per user. The key IDs (which are the wrapped keys) are provided in `publicKey.allowCredentials[].id`, and `allowCredentials` is a list. As an RP, you just provide the full list of key IDs associated with the user, the browser checks which one(s) are actually available, and only asks the user to use one of them.Comment 4: Hey u/Jybodi,  
  
Thank you for your detailed response, and I appreciate your constructive feedback.

I apologize for any confusion that this article may have caused. Our intention was never to mislead anyone, and I must admit that our original intention and explanations in the article were not specific enough. Consequently, I have completely rewritten it to hopefully make things clearer.

Our initial goal was to provide a way to help users select the appropriate YubiKey with an empty / non-complete allowCredential. This aim may have inadvertently led us down an incorrect path. To clarify, our intention was not to select a credential ID per se, but rather to suggest a usage like “use YubiKey A” and then proceed with the assertion. I apologize for this confusion.

We have since revised the article to make it clear that, in the case of non-resident keys, you should set allowCredentials and allow the browser to manage the rest.

Furthermore, it was not our intention to discredit non-resident keys, such as YubiKeys. We strongly believe in their use, particularly for internal authentication purposes among employees, e.g. including for AWS and SSH access, where we also utilize them internally. However, we recognize that, for non-technical external customers, passkeys might be more appropriate.

Thanks for your feedback! If you would like to provide any of your social profile URLs, I would be happy to credit you in the article.Comment 5: You're right - valid point and sorry for not being clear enough in this point. I corrected it to: ""This means the user needs to manually select in an operating system / browser modal which non-resident key should be used.""Comment 6: > I corrected it to: ""This means the user needs to manually select in an operating system / browser modal which non-resident key should be used.""

Your correction remains wrong. There's no selection required in a modal: the user simply taps the desired FIDO token and the browser uses that. See the workflow at the end of my top-level reply.

If you're serious about fixing your misinformation, you effectively need to retract the entire claim you make in this blog post."
16xms0l,Are passkeys secure,"Every article I read about passkeys emphasises that they are very secure. However, given the fact that you can unlock them with your phone code doesn’t this inherently make it less secure. My phone code only has six digits. My wife and children know the code to get into my phone in case of emergency emergency. 

A complex password in one password in 1password seems to me to be much more secure. Am I missing something?",aobtree123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/16xms0l/are_passkeys_secure/,,,"Comment 1: I think you're confusing two separate issues: securing *access* to your Passkey vs. security of using Passkeys with apps & sites.

The first part's all about how you secure access to your Passkey.

If access to your Passkey is secured by a 6-digit phone unlock code, then it's less secure than if you had protected it with an app like 1Pass, or requiring a biometric factor (fingerprint or facial scan), or using a separate physical security key (i.e. a Ubikey).

The second part, which relates to how Passkeys are used by apps & websites, it is widely accepted that a Passkey that resides on your device, and is tied to one (*and only one)* app or website, is MUCH more secure than even a strong password that can be used by *anyone* who knows it, on *any* app or site where you've used it.

So, yes, Passkeys are more secure b/c they're tied to your device and generally require proof of presence (pin, fingerprint/face scan, etc.); but they can be compromised if you don't protect access to them properly (e.g. leave your device unlocked). But that's still a lot more secure than a password that *anyone at all* can use just by knowing the string.Comment 2: They are better than passwords for a few reasons. But in your case, you have compromised the security of your phone, similar to giving your debit card pin away along with the debit card itself.

Passkeys have many advantages over passwords, but you still need to protect them just like you would a password (or debit card pin).

If you want extra security for some of your passkeys you can store the passkey on a security key.

Look at 1Password’s own site and blog to understand why they think passkeys are superior.  You don’t have to remember password or maintain it. You don’t have to have extra 2FA step, because it built into passkey, you are MUCH more protected against phishing attacks. There’s more benefits.

https://blog.1password.com/passkeys-vs-passwords-differences/


Also, if you’re using 1Password to store your passkeys, then your family would have to have access to that to use your passkeys. Your 1Password app requires master password or biometric like Face ID or phone 6-digit passcode. If you chose to use Face ID, 1Password app won’t allow login with phone’s 6 digit passcode. If Face ID is unsuccessful, 1Password falls back to requiring master password.

So basically, even if your family member can get into your phone, they can’t get into your 1Password - as long as they don’t know your master password and you don’t use the passcode option to sign into the app. 
Hopefully that makes sense.


Passwords aren’t going anywhere for a long time. If you feel strongly about using a password, you can still use that.Comment 3: I think that passkeys are secure when used with fingerprint or 3D face recognition (like Face ID).
They are a bit less secure in your case because anyone who knows the PIN could access services that use the passkey.

What is not secure is that even when using the passkey, you can always access via the regular password, and if that is weak, the passkeys are useless.Comment 4: Yes.  

If you don't like exposing your passkeys to your phone, use a Yubikey.  That will remove even the appearance of risk.  (Except the risk of losing your key!  I lost one of mine a year ago.  This is why you have a PIN on the key, and a backup key!)

If you have a USB-C phone with wireless charging, you can just get a Yubikey Nano, plug it in like a dust-cover or port-condom, and generally ignore the USB port.  That way your passkeys (at least the 32 most important ones) are always there, but absolutely inaccessible to hackers.  If you use a decent PIN, it's also inaccessible to pickpockets~!Comment 5: No.Comment 6: So let me get this straight.

It falls back to using master password.

Note that this is not the case with native iPhone Passwords iCloud Keychain. That will allow you to get in and manage your passkeys with the phone’s passcode. But that was the same with passwords too.

I strongly disagree that passkeys are useless if you still have password for a site/service. Sure it means that the company still has your password on their server, just like before; however, you are much better off adding and using the passkey if they offer it. You don’t have to use 2FA to log in, you are protected from phishing attacks, there’s no auto-fill, it’s faster, etc.  You can even have separate passkeys for a site/service per device (non-shareable passkeys) if you want to separate concerns even more.  Or put passkey on physical security key for ultimate, but less convenient, security.  Sure, in many cases it would be optimal to have no password - and that’s the long term goal.  It’s a transition period and I think it’s good to have the fallback to passwords until things are worked out.

16tgvqw,Saving passkeys on Apple KeyChain vs 1Password,"Hi,

I was wondering if it is safer to save passkeys on Apple KeyChain, since access to physical hardware is needed to gain access to accounts rather than 1Password, which currently offers saving passkeys. An additional benefit would be having passwords saved on a seprate platform (1Password) and passkeys saved on another. Would that make any difference or am I just paranoid?",Altruistic_Mouse1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/16tgvqw/saving_passkeys_on_apple_keychain_vs_1password/,,,"Comment 1: You can setup 1Password to use hardware keys as 2-factor so it would be the same amount of security as Keychain in needing physical hardware to access the account on a new device.Comment 2: I think we’re in the stage where best practices are still being figured out.
You have management, ease of sharing, separation of concerns, etc. The biggest reason to use a third party to manage your passkeys is if you are in a mixed environment (iOS AND windows for example). It also keeps things all together under one management roof.

However, I don’t currently have my google passkeys in 1Password. I have a separate google passkey for each device (phone, laptop, desktop) as opposed to a shared passkey.

On one hand, this leads to a proliferation of passkeys. On the other hand, I’ve separated concerns.

I’m thinking of doing the same for the “big” accounts/services.  Still not positive though.

I think this mindset shift is the biggest hurdle to passkeys in the public’s mind. Where before they had a single username and password. It’s easily understood. Now with Passkeys there are (could be) multiple for the same site/service/app. You might have to keep track of all the places you have a passkey for that site/service/app. It a mindset shift.Comment 3: I have chosen to use Apple's keychain for the reasons you mentioned.

I'm not actually certain it would make a huge difference in storing the passwords/passkeys separately because it's not like one is a second factor for the other (though I think actually passkeys technically can be for MFA if the site allows it). But for me, Apple's more locked-down platform is actually the bigger factor.

Not to say that 1Password isn't secure - I actually use it myself for my passwords. But from what I understand (and I could be wrong), the passkeys are synced to all your devices where you're logged in with 1Password. Which includes my Windows PC. I actually don't want that, because I know for a fact that there are malware stealers that specifically target OTP 2FA tokens stored by password managers, so the same would probably happen for passkeys. I find it much more unlikely that will happen on an iPhone or mac.

I don't really care about portability of passkeys across ecosystems because you can just create multiple ones.Comment 4: 1password uses AES-256 encryption which is still unbroken if one uses a strong password. 1Password uses this device encryption key so that shouldn’t be a problem. However Apple’s iCloud Keychain also uses pretty strong encryption, but I couldn’t find the details. So imho it’s really a matter of choice. If you only use Apple devices using iCloud Keychain might be a bit more convenient. But if you also use other devices 1password might be a better option for you.Comment 5: What's the implication of allowing third party browser extensions the ability to intercept these passkey registrations, I know everyone wants to own the passkey, you own the Passkey you ""own"" the user, but until there's a framework to protect consumers with third party extensions I'm sticking with Google/apple managersComment 6: \+1  


Two other core questions that you need to answer yourself:  
1) Do you only have Apple devices? If yes then going with the iCloud Keychain is probably the more convenient way (and cheaper because you don't need to pay for 1Password). But if there's one device you regularly use that is non-Apple, then it might make more sense to go with 1Password (even though setting up a passkey on this other device isn' too much effort IMO, recovery may be though)  
2) I would try to keep the service / password manager wher you currently store your passwords, as you would still need this service anyways and then having both your passwords and passkeys in the same place is probably the best experience.Comment 7: Does the icloud app on windows support use of passkeys stored in iCloud?

However Apple’s iCloud Keychain also uses pretty strong encryption, but I couldn’t find the details. So imho it’s really a matter of choice. If you only use Apple devices using iCloud Keychain might be a bit more convenient. But if you also use other devices 1password might be a better option for you.Comment 5: What's the implication of allowing third party browser extensions the ability to intercept these passkey registrations, I know everyone wants to own the passkey, you own the Passkey you ""own"" the user, but until there's a framework to protect consumers with third party extensions I'm sticking with Google/apple managersComment 6: \+1  


Two other core questions that you need to answer yourself:  
1) Do you only have Apple devices? If yes then going with the iCloud Keychain is probably the more convenient way (and cheaper because you don't need to pay for 1Password). But if there's one device you regularly use that is non-Apple, then it might make more sense to go with 1Password (even though setting up a passkey on this other device isn' too much effort IMO, recovery may be though)  
2) I would try to keep the service / password manager wher you currently store your passwords, as you would still need this service anyways and then having both your passwords and passkeys in the same place is probably the best experience.Comment 7: Does the icloud app on windows support use of passkeys stored in iCloud? I know it can support the passwords stored there."

I have a PayPal Passkey, that I can find in the list of Google Passwords. So its there. And now?
Is the PayPal passkey also on my phone?

But if I have a Bitwarden Passkey I am still not sure. 

I feel stupid, but i am sure that sooner or later I will be enlighted. Or a book ""Passkeys For Dummies"" will appear.

In the case of being close to a computer it is also possible that that computer ""knows"" already who I am.

Pfff.

Will be greatfull for a site that explains for dummies like me.Comment 7: I'm in the same boat. I feel like I wish someone would either show a tutorial on how to do so with a Pixel phone or at least someone should show how to do so on a YouTube video or something.Comment 8: Haha.

You can create passkeys on these devices:

A laptop or desktop that runs at least Windows 10, macOS Ventura, or ChromeOS 109
A mobile device that runs at least iOS 16 or Android 9
A hardware security key that supports the FIDO2 protocol
Your computer or mobile device will also need a supported browser like:

Chrome 109 or up
Safari 16 or up
Edge 109 or up
To create and use a passkey, your device must have the following enabled:

Screen lock
Bluetooth

Their main purpose is to replace the issues that come with alpha-numeric passwords: creating, maintaining, remembering, changing, copying and pasting, etc.
Passkeys come with added benefit that each device can have unique passkey (if you want a little more maintenance).

However, you must still safeguard the device.  Passkeys are better that passwords, but ARE NOT a replacement for hardware security keys (yubikey, etc). It’s an in between. 
With a password, you’re typing it or pasting it somewhere which can be intercepted (like phishing site for example). This is not possible with passkeys. The human error is removed from the process.

Windows has been doing something similar with windows hello for a few years. Now this concept can be used for any site or service. On windows the same system that stores windows hello would store the passkey. Each of your devices would have its own passkey. So getting into one device doesn’t give access to all devices. But my iPhone is separated too with its own security model and own passkey.

Also, remember that passkeys are two parts. (EDIT 2023-08-09: for clarification: private key is stored on device and public key is stored on server/service). Your device only has half the necessary keys. The other half is on the service. This also forces a unique passkey for every site/service eliminating the concept of password reuse. This is one biggest reasons for passkeys.

Please keep in mind that I may be wrong about some oft this. I just have a general understanding and had many of the same questions as you. I think there will need to be a lot of education about passkeys. They are better, but slightly more complicated. The payoff is when you use them. Things just work auto-magically. No auto-fill or copying username and password or all that jazz.

The biggest issue currently is import/export of passkeys from one provider to another like if you were to change from 1Password Bitwarden. Import/export with passwords is relatively trivial (although very insecure).  There are difficult issues doing this with passkeys. This is why I’m waiting for 1password and iOS 17 support before more fully embracing passkeys. I currently only have google passkeys and manage them with google, not a third party manager like 1password/Bitwarden.Comment 3: This is important to know, thanks for clarifying. Sticking to generated passwords and manager.Comment 4: So basically, they were already planning this passkey nonsense when they decided on the Windows 11 requirements. What about devices without TPM?Comment 5: Mostly correct. Passkeys still work on devices that don’t have TPM. It’s less secure. 
My PC is from 2012 and windows 10. No TPM, so google passkey and windows hello is all software based. My windows 11 laptop and iPhone however have hardware TPM/security moduleComment 6: > Also, remember that passkeys are two parts. Your device only has half the necessary keys.

I'm not sure you can say that passkeys are two parts. The thing that forces unique passkeys is that each key can only be used with a specific RP ID (Relying Party ID). 

  >  In the context of the WebAuthn API, a relying party identifier is a valid domain string identifying the WebAuthn Relying Party on whose behalf a given registration or authentication ceremony is being performed. A public key credential can only be used for authentication with the same entity (as identified by RP ID) it was registered with.

That’s my plan.Comment 8: Not sure what the official support is but you can also use a password manager like 1Password  to store the keys encrypted on the disk or on cloud.Comment 9: Agreed, i was trying to keep it simple by emphasizing that not everything is stored on the end user’s device in the way passwords are. Thank you for the clarification.

Which leads me to one of the biggest hurdles for passkeys - public education around them. Imagine saying what you replied to me to Grandma or Grandpa.  They would just huff and say “I’ll stick with passwords.”  There has to be a simple (or less technical) explanation to overcome people’s hesitancy.

In my mind, the greatest beneficiaries of passkeys are the less technically inclined. The people who are more likely to fall for phishing attacks and such. Unfortunately they’re  also the ones more likely to stick to old familiar ways (username and password) if passkeys are seen as overly complex (or if the implemented is complex).

For example, one thing that some people may not intuitively get is that passkeys aren’t (always) 1:1 with passwords. That is to say there might me multiple passkeys for an single account/service. This would be a separate passkey for each device (assuming no sharing). Like on google passkey manager, I have separate registrations for Pc, Laptop, and iPhone. It’s easy to see this as confusing from the perspective of a password user. You’re actually registering your device (AND you via biometrics) instead of just you via a password. It actually is more complex to some degree. The payoff is in the added security and ease of use. Some complexity is introduced in the creation and management phase for huge gains in other areas.

Another area is that the more ecosystems you’re in the more complex the management becomes. For example, if you have a PC and an iPhone, you’ll now be in at least two passkey ecosystems (windows hello and iCloud Keychain). This isn’t even counting if you you use a third party password manager like 1password or Bitwarden.  I think it will take some time to figure out an organic and efficient way to manage passkeys. For me, I’ll let google manage my google passkeys, but use 1Password for lots of the smaller things. Same for Microsoft and apple. There’s eventually going to be a best practice with respect to separation of concerns. But that’s a few years out. 


I think another hesitancy issue is a user’s sense of a loss of control. It can FEEL like you’re giving up too much control with a passkey. A black box. When in reality it’s a far better system.Comment 10: That could work in theory too tbh. Once it's matured and standardComment 11: Yes, and I could also paint the middle toe of my right foot with purple nail polish and dance bavkwards around a fire made with eucalyptus leaves.

They want you to have less control of your accounts and your data.Comment 12: Ya, it’s still gonna be awhile for best practices. Waiting on ios17 and 3rd party for full support.  
If you want to get started though I would highly recommend moving your google account to passkeys. You’ll still have a username password for the foreseeable future as an alternate way to sign in, but it’s a very good way to get your feet wet and start seeing the benefits of passkeys.Comment 13: Lol ok dude","Windows in general doesn't lock down their systems like non rooted Android does for example, so things like session tokens in cookies/browser data, Windows NTLM credentials, Network passwords, browser stored password databases etc, are all stealable when a bad actor gets access to your PC.

Think of the device as a keychain, and the passkeys as well, keys.

If both of them need to open their respective doors, they can do so by taking the same keychain (the device) and using the correct key (the passkey).

The thing is, because they are sharing the device, either of them can access both of their accounts, just like how you can open both doors when you have access to the keychain, because it has both keys on it.

14h4xvs,N00b Question Re: Passkeys,"My question: Passkeys just seem like an inconvenient hassle -- what's the point?

Background: I'm not a tech professional, but I am generally an early adopter of technology. At present I use 1Password. It has 256-bit encryption, it syncs across all my devices, and I can access my vault from the web. If I want to login to anything, anywhere, I just have to remember the master password for my 1Password account. I can do it from my desktop, my laptop, my phone, my mom's computer if I'm visiting at her house....anywhere.

With passkeys, I'm basically trapped into carrying my phone everywhere -- no phone, no login. And if the device I'm using doesn't play nicely with my phone (ex: Apple laptop w/ Android phone), I'm stuck -- no login. Is that right?

Is a passkey really any more secure than my encrypted 1Password vault? Why would any person jump through all of these asinine hoops (ex: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it\_seems\_that\_you\_cant\_delete\_your\_passkeys\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it_seems_that_you_cant_delete_your_passkeys_from/)) to switch over?",robbjunk9999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/14h4xvs/n00b_question_re_passkeys/,,,"Comment 1: For those of us who have been randomly generating passwords for ages (speaking as another 1Password user) passkeys offer only a few security improvements for us:

\- Domain scoping - Passkey for [google.com](https://google.com) won't be usable at goog-phishing.com making it MUCH harder for attackers to steal your credential

\- MITM resistant - passkeys (like other U2F standards) by design count the number of hops they go through from user to the intended recipient, so anyone that grabs your key in transit would result in a failed login for you and a bad key for them, whereas passwords and OTPs will generally work

As for the no phone/no login point - when logging into a new device without passkeys you always need password and MFA. Receiving the SMS or generating the 6 digit code requires a phone so if you're screwed without a phone either way, why not make it more cryptographically secure if that's the case?

More importantly though - mom, dad, grandparents, cousins, etc. aren't as good about randomizing passwords and don't have them stored anywhere outside their brain or their Notes app. This is a HUGE improvement for them, since each site gets a unique key that's only accessible on their trusted devices.

&#x200B;

TL;DR the encrypted stuff in your 1Password vault is unencrypted when the password is typed/filled in on a website, and therefore can be taken and used by attackers elsewhere. Passkeys can't.Comment 2: >With passkeys, I'm basically trapped into carrying my phone everywhere -- no phone, no login. And if the device I'm using doesn't play nicely with my phone (ex: Apple laptop w/ Android phone), I'm stuck -- no login. Is that right?

I'm with you on this one, and I was pretty paranoid about it and really held off on enabling passkeys.

But then I also am a believer in 2FA/MFA as a good security tool. As a victim of password leaks and whatever attack you'd call someone using the ""forgot password"" feature, 2FA has been really helpful in securing all my accounts. I'm happy to say that during a couple of years of phishing attacks from the misuse of COVID tracking data, all my accounts (and my identity and money) are all intact.

And because I use 2FA, I am needing my phone with me all the time anyway, to get my SMS OTPs and TOTP generators. I'm not typing my Bitwarden credentials in some random PC or phone that may be compromised.

And because I need my phone all the time anyway, it dawned on me that passkeys are practically the same, and I wouldn't be able to login without my phone or trusted device anyway even with 2FA. 

It was just this sense of ""loss of control"" by not needing to input my OTPs when in fact passkeys work exactly the same, and with the convenience of never needing to type anything or even get it wrong.

All that being said, passkeys are still pretty useless because we are just moving towards it. The security benefits aren't apparent yet because there's nothing we can log onto right now that is exclusively using passkeys. Ergo, there is still ""something that we know"" (the password) that can be stolen from us without us knowing. With no passwords and only passkeys, you'd have to steal someone's device quite literally to gain access. 

While it means you now have to carry a device with you all the time, that's the same reason why safes with keys are very secure, versus ones with codes. You can look at the code or listen to it or find a reference to it and gain access. With an exclusively key-based safe, you have to steal a key or destroy a building (and the safe). The fact that you can't even enter your own accounts without your pass keys makes it more secure - security doesn't care who you are, if you're not good, you're not in.

&#x200B;

>Why would any person jump through all of these asinine hoops (ex: https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it\_seems\_that\_you\_cant\_delete\_your\_passkeys\_from/) to switch over?

Specifically for this, I think its more of an RTFM thing. I read all I could about using them and basically, turn on your Apple/Google cloud password manager, make passkeys using the default browser, can delete them later in the same password managers that you turned on. 

User basically just missed step 1. I've deleted like, six passkeys today.Comment 3: *""As for the no phone/no login point - when logging into a new device without passkeys you always need password and MFA. Receiving the SMS or generating the 6 digit code requires a phone so if you're screwed without a phone either way, why not make it more cryptographically secure if that's the case?""*

I don't use my phone for MFA:  To get MFA codes I use either VOIP services (which I can access via my web browser) or 1Password's own code-generator/authenticator (which is accessible via the browser extension).

If I (1) generate a passkey for Website on my phone, then (2) want to login to Website via computer, I have to go through a whole song-and-dance, connect my phone to my computer via Bluetooth, and hope they play nice together, correct?Comment 4: Oh, that whole auth flow (login challenge > QR code > scan with phone > approve login > phone sends auth via Bluetooth) totally sucks and I have no idea why that’s being pushed. In my experience, it’s a much simpler login flow:

1.	⁠Login challenge > enter username
2.	⁠Passkey prompt > passkey provided Note: Passkeys can be provided by 1Password’s Beta browser extension now if you want to try! Google password sync and iCloud password sync also support passkey storage natively now.
3.	⁠Login approved

No voip lines, no extra TOTP prompt, no other devices - super easy.Comment 5: (1) Thanks for the back-and-forth:  I've Googled around a zillion times, read all of the ""here's how passkeys work"" websites, and none of them really explain the steps.

(2) Re: your steps above, there are still some concepts I'm clearly missing. Specifically:

1. ""*Login challenge>enter username""* \-- Just to make sure we're talking about the same situation/parameters, this hypothetical assumes a user attempting to login at a computer, not on a mobile device, correct?
2. ""*Passkey prompt > passkey provided""* Here's the crucial point where I'm lost: What is ""***providing***"" the passkey? 1-A phone that you have in your hand while you're trying to login; or 2-the computer you're actually web browsing/logging in with?
   1. (Phone)
      1. If you're sitting on your computer trying to login, but it's your phone providing the passkey, how is the passkey transmitted from phone > computer > website without a Bluetooth connection?
      2. More significantly, if its your phone providing the passkey, that still goes back to my primary objection: I want to login on ***one*** device, which right now I can. With 2FA, I either get VOIP messages directly on my computer, or use 1Password's built-in authenticator to generate one-time codes. If lose my phone while traveling in a foreign country, and need to access my bank, or my credit card company in a hurry, I just get the information from my 1Password vault. If my phone is stolen/destroyed/dropped in the ocean, or even if it's just in the other room and I'm too f\*\*\*ng lazy to go get it, I can still login to my websites. If my entire house burns down and every device I have is destroyed, I just need my 1Password account recovery information to completely recreate my vault. (*And yes, I understand that both Apple and Google have graciously offered to backup your keys. But that locks me into their ecosystems -- my passkeys become hostage to Apple or Google. Conversely, I can leave 1Password anytime I want, export my vault and take it with me to another password manager provider.)*
   2. (Computer)
      1. ""*Note: Passkeys can be provided by 1Password’s Beta browser extension now...*""I thought that one of the points of passkeys was that they were restricted to devices with biometric ID. If you have a password to access your computer, and your computer stores the passkey, then you're still using a password -- anyone who can crack your computer's main login password now has access to all of your passkeys.
      2. In that same vein, I tried to set up a passkey on my computer for my Google account, and got an error message stating that I needed to activate Windows Hello....which requires me to buy an IR camera.
      3. The 1Password beta ([https://support.1password.com/save-use-passkeys/](https://support.1password.com/save-use-passkeys/)) website says: ""*Because passkeys saved in 1Password are like any other items, you can also view,* ***edit, move, and even share them with other people***."" Isn't the whole point of passkeys that they are unique to the device you're using them on--you need a different passkey for every different device? How can you move/share passkeys between devices?

Or the laptop I once had with a fingerprint reader that worked ***maybe*** 1 out of every 20 times I tried using it? If my password isn't working for some reason, I can just go and reset it. What do I do when I'm trying to access my bank account for something important, I show my face to my phone, and it says ""access denied""?  How many roads do I have to go down before I identify the problem, much less correct it?  The phone's camera? The phone's passkey code? The communication/handshake between the phone and the bank? The bank's own software? In the meantime I'm stuck not being able to access anything because of a failure of technology I can't understand or fix. 

Thanks again for the straight talk.Comment 6: About 3 the principle behind passkeys are relatively simple. The server sends a certificate to the user. The device by the user puts the digital signature on the certificate and sends it back. Since this digital signature can only be made with the private key and only be verified with the public key the server is sure that it is the correct user who is signing in. Since the private key is a carefully kept secret. In order to get this you might want to look in the following subjects : 

\- public-private keypair

\- hashing

\- digital signatures

By the way TLS works the same way. You know this lock thing in your browser.Comment 7: >Finally, I just don't trust the technology. The tech behind passwords with 2FA I understand.

Basically, the point is that you prove that you have the device, just like a physical key (it really does help to think of passkeys as actual keys). On devices with biometrics, and the biometrics fail, you use your PIN. That alone proves you have the device (2nd factor) and something that identifies you (PIN, fingerprint, face).

I'm on iOS, so it will take me less than 10 seconds from not reading my face twice and pushing my PIN. On MacOS, about 30 seconds, because my password is a bit long and TouchID can be slow.Comment 8: Public-private keypair and digital signatures I get.  What I don't get is how the actual signature gets put on the certificate. If I'm logging on to a website with my computer, but the signature is on my cell phone, how does that signature get from my cell phone to my computer to the website?  And again, I thought that passkeys were supposed to be device-specific -- how could a signature on my cell phone be used when it's my computer logging in to the website?

Maybe a concrete example would make more sense:  Let's say I travel to a relative's house, but on the way I lose my phone+phone case, which has my ID and credit cards in it. 

(1) ***Using 1Password***:  I contact my partner who gives me the login info for my 1Password vault. I login to 1Password at my relative's house, get my passwords, and start logging on to my bank's website etc. to put holds on my accounts and get new cards issued.

(2) ***Using Passkeys.***  I'm just screwed, right? All of my logins are tied to the physical phone. Once I lose the phone, I can't login anywhere.Comment 9: With the private key the device can make a signature. A digital signature is nothing more than a hash encrypted with the private key. The digital signature is put on the certificate and send to the website. You are right that the original idea behind webauthn is that the private key is device specific. That's still the case with a Yubikey which is the same procedure. However since nobody uses that they had to come up with a solution. Passkeys are exactly the same as webauthn. Except the private key is synchronised over your devices.   
In your example. You have lost your phone. On the phone you have 1password running and are logged in. Which effectively means that your phone has access to the private keys stored in the 1password vault.   
If you log in at your aunts house and somehow you can login on your 1password account then you can see your passwords. And just like that the browsers at your aunts house has access to the private keys in your 1password account. So when you try to login on your google account at your aunts house the 1password plugin in the browser reads out the private key in your vault. And it gets a certificate from google stating that it is you who is loggin in. The plugin hashes the certificate and encrypts this hash using the private key. And puts this signature on the certificate. 

At google using your public key the signature is decrypted to the original hash. They also hash the certificate. If the two hashes are identical your are logged in.Comment 10: >Passkeys are exactly the same as webauthn. Except the private key is synchronised over your devices.

I think we're going at cross purposes -- I really appreciate your effort in explaining, but it seems like you're answering questions I'm not asking, or I'm asking the questions badly.   I'll try brevity/one question at a time:

From a layman's perspective, ""synchronised over your devices"" seems like the exact opposite of ""device-specific."" To me ""synchronised over devices"" means that you can take the passkey on my phone and copy it to my tablet, my laptop, my sister's laptop, her boyfriend's laptop, the computer of some random guy down the street, etc.? I thought the whole point of passkeys was that they were tied to the device.Comment 11: Ah, that's your question. Well in case of those hardware authentication devices like yubikey you are 100% right. The private key stayes on the device and never leaves it. So the private key is tied to your device and therefore device specific. 

In case of the passkey implementation it is more like the private key is tied to your password vault. So yes on any device where you can use the password vault you can use the passkey to log in. 

Reading back your original question. If I understand you correctly one of your questions is what is the point of using passkeys versus passwords. Correct?Comment 12: Right. I get that passkeys are more secure than an encrypted password manager using individually-generated random passwords, but not orders of magnitude more secure in an average person’s use case.

But for me, they also seem significantly more of a hassle, since I have to have my phone with me whenever I want to login somewhere, and I either risk being locked out forever if I lose my phone, or I become forever beholden to Apple or Google to backup my passkeys.","My question: Passkeys just seem like an inconvenient hassle -- what's the point?

Background: I'm not a tech professional, but I am generally an early adopter of technology. At present I use 1Password. It has 256-bit encryption, it syncs across all my devices, and I can access my vault from the web. If I want to login to anything, anywhere, I just have to remember the master password for my 1Password account. I can do it from my desktop, my laptop, my phone, my mom's computer if I'm visiting at her house....anywhere.

With passkeys, I'm basically trapped into carrying my phone everywhere -- no phone, no login. And if the device I'm using doesn't play nicely with my phone (ex: Apple laptop w/ Android phone), I'm stuck -- no login. Is that right?

Is a passkey really any more secure than my encrypted 1Password vault? Why would any person jump through all of these asinine hoops (ex: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it\_seems\_that\_you\_cant\_delete\_your\_passkeys\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it_seems_that_you_cant_delete_your_passkeys_from/)) to switch over?Comment 1: For those of us who have been randomly generating passwords for ages (speaking as another 1Password user) passkeys offer only a few security improvements for us:

\- Domain scoping - Passkey for [google.com](https://google.com) won't be usable at goog-phishing.com making it MUCH harder for attackers to steal your credential

\- MITM resistant - passkeys (like other U2F standards) by design count the number of hops they go through from user to the intended recipient, so anyone that grabs your key in transit would result in a failed login for you and a bad key for them, whereas passwords and OTPs will generally work

As for the no phone/no login point - when logging into a new device without passkeys you always need password and MFA. Receiving the SMS or generating the 6 digit code requires a phone so if you're screwed without a phone either way, why not make it more cryptographically secure if that's the case?

More importantly though - mom, dad, grandparents, cousins, etc. aren't as good about randomizing passwords and don't have them stored anywhere outside their brain or their Notes app. This is a HUGE improvement for them, since each site gets a unique key that's only accessible on their trusted devices.

&#x200B;

TL;DR the encrypted stuff in your 1Password vault is unencrypted when the password is typed/filled in on a website, and therefore can be taken and used by attackers elsewhere. Passkeys can't.Comment 2: >With passkeys, I'm basically trapped into carrying my phone everywhere -- no phone, no login. And if the device I'm using doesn't play nicely with my phone (ex: Apple laptop w/ Android phone), I'm stuck -- no login. Is that right?

I'm with you on this one, and I was pretty paranoid about it and really held off on enabling passkeys.

But then I also am a believer in 2FA/MFA as a good security tool. As a victim of password leaks and whatever attack you'd call someone using the ""forgot password"" feature, 2FA has been really helpful in securing all my accounts. I'm happy to say that during a couple of years of phishing attacks from the misuse of COVID tracking data, all my accounts (and my identity and money) are all intact.

And because I use 2FA, I am needing my phone with me all the time anyway, to get my SMS OTPs and TOTP generators. I'm not typing my Bitwarden credentials in some random PC or phone that may be compromised.

And because I need my phone all the time anyway, it dawned on me that passkeys are practically the same, and I wouldn't be able to login without my phone or trusted device anyway even with 2FA. 

It was just this sense of ""loss of control"" by not needing to input my OTPs when in fact passkeys work exactly the same, and with the convenience of never needing to type anything or even get it wrong.

All that being said, passkeys are still pretty useless because we are just moving towards it. The security benefits aren't apparent yet because there's nothing we can log onto right now that is exclusively using passkeys. Ergo, there is still ""something that we know"" (the password) that can be stolen from us without us knowing. With no passwords and only passkeys, you'd have to steal someone's device quite literally to gain access. 

While it means you now have to carry a device with you all the time, that's the same reason why safes with keys are very secure, versus ones with codes. You can look at the code or listen to it or find a reference to it and gain access. With an exclusively key-based safe, you have to steal a key or destroy a building (and the safe). The fact that you can't even enter your own accounts without your pass keys makes it more secure - security doesn't care who you are, if you're not good, you're not in.

>Why would any person jump through all of these asinine hoops (ex: https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/10zm5xx/it\_seems\_that\_you\_cant\_delete\_your\_passkeys\_from/) to switch over?

Specifically for this, I think its more of an RTFM thing. I read all I could about using them and basically, turn on your Apple/Google cloud password manager, make passkeys using the default browser, can delete them later in the same password managers that you turned on. 

User basically just missed step 1. I've deleted like, six passkeys today.Comment 3: *""As for the no phone/no login point - when logging into a new device without passkeys you always need password and MFA. Receiving the SMS or generating the 6 digit code requires a phone so if you're screwed without a phone either way, why not make it more cryptographically secure if that's the case?""*

I don't use my phone for MFA:  To get MFA codes I use either VOIP services (which I can access via my web browser) or 1Password's own code-generator/authenticator (which is accessible via the browser extension).

If I (1) generate a passkey for Website on my phone, then (2) want to login to Website via computer, I have to go through a whole song-and-dance, connect my phone to my computer via Bluetooth, and hope they play nice together, correct?Comment 4: Oh, that whole auth flow (login challenge > QR code > scan with phone > approve login > phone sends auth via Bluetooth) totally sucks and I have no idea why that’s being pushed. In my experience, it’s a much simpler login flow:

1.	⁠Login challenge > enter username
2.	⁠Passkey prompt > passkey provided Note: Passkeys can be provided by 1Password’s Beta browser extension now if you want to try! Google password sync and iCloud password sync also support passkey storage natively now.
3.	⁠Login approved

No voip lines, no extra TOTP prompt, no other devices - super easy.Comment 5: (1) Thanks for the back-and-forth:  I've Googled around a zillion times, read all of the ""here's how passkeys work"" websites, and none of them really explain the steps.

(2) Re: your steps above, there are still some concepts I'm clearly missing. Specifically:

1. ""*Login challenge>enter username""* \-- Just to make sure we're talking about the same situation/parameters, this hypothetical assumes a user attempting to login at a computer, not on a mobile device, correct?
2. ""*Passkey prompt > passkey provided""* Here's the crucial point where I'm lost: What is ""***providing***"" the passkey? 1-A phone that you have in your hand while you're trying to login; or 2-the computer you're actually web browsing/logging in with?
   1. (Phone)
      1. If you're sitting on your computer trying to login, but it's your phone providing the passkey, how is the passkey transmitted from phone > computer > website without a Bluetooth connection?
      2. More significantly, if its your phone providing the passkey, that still goes back to my primary objection: I want to login on ***one*** device, which right now I can. With 2FA, I either get VOIP messages directly on my computer, or use 1Password's built-in authenticator to generate one-time codes. If lose my phone while traveling in a foreign country, and need to access my bank, or my credit card company in a hurry, I just get the information from my 1Password vault. If my phone is stolen/destroyed/dropped in the ocean, or even if it's just in the other room and I'm too f\*\*\*ng lazy to go get it, I can still login to my websites. If my entire house burns down and every device I have is destroyed, I just need my 1Password account recovery information to completely recreate my vault. (*And yes, I understand that both Apple and Google have graciously offered to backup your keys. But that locks me into their ecosystems -- my passkeys become hostage to Apple or Google. Conversely, I can leave 1Password anytime I want, export my vault and take it with me to another password manager provider.)*
   2. (Computer)
      1. ""*Note: Passkeys can be provided by 1Password’s Beta browser extension now...*""I thought that one of the points of passkeys was that they were restricted to devices with biometric ID. If you have a password to access your computer, and your computer stores the passkey, then you're still using a password -- anyone who can crack your computer's main login password now has access to all of your passkeys.
      2. In that same vein, I tried to set up a passkey on my computer for my Google account, and got an error message stating that I needed to activate Windows Hello....which requires me to buy an IR camera.
      3. The 1Password beta ([https://support.1password.com/save-use-passkeys/](https://support.1password.com/save-use-passkeys/)) website says: ""*Because passkeys saved in 1Password are like any other items, you can also view,* ***edit, move, and even share them with other people***."" Isn't the whole point of passkeys that they are unique to the device you're using them on--you need a different passkey for every different device? How can you move/share passkeys between devices?

How many roads do I have to go down before I identify the problem, much less correct it?  The phone's camera? The phone's passkey code? The communication/handshake between the phone and the bank?

Thank you!Comment 4: Google Authenticator did the trick, thanks"
13jzhly,Passkey question from security n000b,"Hi, apologies if this is a dumb/repetitive question.

I was under the impression that the whole point of passkeys was that authentication went through your device with backup of passkeys in the cloud.  I set up a google passkey on my iPhone, which (in theory) stores it to my iCloud keychain and gives me access via iPhone/iPad.  But every time I log into google on my work laptop, I get a password prompt and an option to set up a passkey via Windows Hello.  What happened to QR code scanning so that I wouldn’t need to litter every device with passkeys?  Am I not understanding how these work?

And are they supposed to ask for a password at all?  I figured of all sites, Google would be the furthest ahead but it doesn’t seem like it’s working as I understood it to work.  Am I wrong?",this_for_loona,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/13jzhly/passkey_question_from_security_n000b/,,,"Comment 1: Passkey implementations are platform specific.  They are probably not going to make it easy for multi-platform usage because everyone is trying to keep their users on their own ecosystems.  Once (or if ever) the platforms allow other sync providers, then maybe we'll see more consistent behaviors implemented across the platforms.

This is also something new.  Sometimes what they say is not what they implement fully yet, so you might have to wait a bit to see how things pan out.  It's going to be novelties for everyone for a while.Comment 2: I tried the same at my work with the same result. At my work Bluetooth is blocked / switched off by the IT people. Don’t know if that’s the reason, but for sure Bluetooth is necessary for authorization with passkeys between devices. Starting from iOS 17 and Android 14 third party password managers can be used to store the passkeys. Let’s see if that would be a solution.Comment 3: The problem here isn't Google per se, but the fact that you are also using Apple.

Passkeys are quite a mess if youre not using the default browsers (Chrome for Google and Safari for Apple). Apple won't let you use iCloud Keychain synced passkeys via Chrome even if theyre already on your device. Likewise, Google will delete passkeys from your device if you log out of or delete Chrome.

Windows basically works like old school passkeys without actual syncing. Ergo, old school ""make a passkey for each device you need to log on with"". At least this will be the case for passkeys that live ""natively"" on the device.

You can install iCloud Keychain Extension and Google Chrome to get your passkeys from iCloud and Google to sync with your Windows device and allow you to login directly from there.

If you are literally the only one who will be using your work laptop, and using passkeys is allowed by your IT, and you are sure that you can delete your Windows passkeys in case you need to hand it back, then that is the only safe situation where generating another passkey for your work laptop is a good and sound idea.

But that still doesnt explain why you didnt get a passkey prompt via QR code.

The answer is that implementation is a total mess. In my passkey journey just today trying things out, I discovered that in my case at least, I can only invoke a passkey login to Google if I use the Google Accounts login page specifically. Not Gmail, not anything else. I have to use Google Accounts login page.

Adobe is even worse - while the website will pull up the correct login page, but the mobile apps will pull a very similar looking but definitely very different login page without passkey options.

Passkeys are a bitch right now, but it is at least good to practice using them. We need to get used to it now and report and complain about usability issues, or else, this theoretically better security option will become a headache to most people.Comment 4: thank you so much for this response.  at least it tells me it’s not who’s crazy.

I love the idea of passkeys and I’m hoping that ios17 will make them easier to use.  I use bitwarden for all my passwords and I know they’re working on passkeys integration but they need iOS to allow third parties to manage passkeys.Comment 5: Not an expert on the current protocols, but I think it may be the other way around: Bitwarden should allow iOS to manage its passkeys. 

Passkeys are hardware-bound. Bitwarden isn’t hardware, and the thing that controls the hardware is iOS. Imagine handing over the keys to some stranger (Bitwarden) and letting it ship it off to other devices you have zero control and verification on. The reason why iCloud Keychain works securely is that it knows that the person who has the keys on one keychain is the same person on another keychain, hence you can give them duplicates. With Bitwarden, iCloud doesn’t know if the keychain the duplicates are going to are the same person - it’s insecure.

I expect that the “master control” of passkeys will always be the OS, because the OS controls the security chip.

Case in point, again with my experience today with MacOS: Chrome will not read passkeys in MacOS that were created outside Chrome (i.e. Safari/iCloud Keychain/Password settings). You can still make passkeys accessible only in Chrome, and they will not show up in MacOS Passwords, and will be deleted if you log off the Chrome profile used when generating the passkey or delete Chrome altogether. But MacOS still has full control over that passkey, it’s just that you have to do it through Chrome.

And when you check Google documentation, iCloud Keychain sync and access is on Googles timeline, not Apple’s.

If anything my take here is that Microsoft is actually doing it best, followed by Apple, with Google doing the worst job.Comment 6: again, thank you for this detailed explanation.","Hi, apologies if this is a dumb/repetitive question.

13ayd6y,Issues with Yubikeys,"I did try passkeys with two of my Google account with activated 2FA with 2 Yubikeys without pin.  
First it did look to work fine. ""Manage your Google Account"" > Security > Passkeys > did list both Yubikeys automatically. I could login on my desktop using my Windows pin and I could login using fingerprint on my phone and Android pin on my tablet.  
But when I did try to login using the password + Yubikey  it did ask for the Yubikey pin. When I input the key it was accepted but then I did get ""This security key doesn't look familiar. Please try a different one.""  
After I removed the  Yubikeys listed in Passkeys, both 2FA Yubikeys did also disappeared. I could recreate all on one of the two accounts. After that I could login using password + Yubikey again.  
But I could not add the Yubikeys again to the second Google account anymore. After typing the Yubikey pin I got the error ""Something went wrong. Try again. Remove your Security Key and insert it again. If it has a button or a gold disk, tap it."". Doing so, I get the same error.  
I did try it on the other account again with the same error.  


So I end up with accounts that can be accessed using passkeys or using a password without 2FA.

My conclusion is that the Google Passkeys implementation is chaotic, clearly not tested properly and unfit to be used.Comment 2: I have a similar issue as well.

After they were added as passkeys, I could no longer re-add them as 2FA security keys. (The discontinued U2F key was only mentioned because it couldn't be added as a passkey, and is now my only physical key under 2FA)

On Android, it's your PIN pattern (depeding on device) and on Windows it's your Windows Hello PIN.Comment 2: Thanks for the reply.

All of those seem less secure than a 2FA-support passphrase. Since security is only as secure as the weakest gate keeping the bad guys out, Passkeys then seem not-so-secure. It seems like your best bet would be to use the strongest, reliable system you have, which is already passphrases.

I've been wondering about this for awhile. The unreliability of Passkeys (because of the unreliability of biometrics) leads them to poorly secured fallbacks.

I see lots of industry movement (MS, Google, Apple, FIDO, etc) so I'm sure I'm not the first person to think about this. So I'm genuinely confused how we are supposed to secure things this way. I totally get that this reduces frustration, but is it worth the cost of security?Comment 3: The way I read your comment, I cannot tell if you are saying the strongest form of security is using a passphrase which is to be verified locally (similar to a pin) or remotely (similar to a password). In the first case, Passkeys are not intended to help when an attacker has already compromised the device being used to perform a login to a remote server; the device is already compromised, so authenticating with a remote service from the device will provide an attacker access regardless of the method being used. In the second case, this is precisely the problem that Passkeys solve and why they offer better security.Comment 4: If I understand you correctly, you are saying that passkeys are device dependent, thus depending on the device's weakest security (biometric, pattern, pin, etc).

That still doesn't seem secure. It is like connect two ropes with a thread an expecting it to be as strong as a rope.

2fa supported passphrases don't rely on local device security. They exist separately from the device. Of course if your passphrase is stored in easily accessible or plaintext on the device, well, that's dumb.

Is the argument being made that personal devices are more easily or better secured than a passphrase with 2fa? That's hard to imagine. For my critical applications my passphrase is dozens of characters long with 2fa (in one particular case, 3fa). 

It's just hard to believe that it makes sense to make my entire security strategy dependent on one device that is poorly secured with biometrics, pins or patterns.

Maybe there are better ways of securing devices and I'm just not aware of them. 

OR... is the idea that light security needs can be met this way? I could buy that. I have throwaway accounts with simple passwords that could be clearly more easily accessed with a device-based passkey.

Hmmm.. what if you drop your device in the sewer?Comment 5: > If I understand you correctly, you are saying that passkeys are device dependent, thus depending on the device's weakest security (biometric, pattern, pin, etc).

Correct, but this assumes even this weakest link is strong enough to be cost prohibitive to attack (or at least more expensive than the weakest point using passwords).

> That still doesn't seem secure.

What about it doesn’t make it seem secure to you? The idea behind WebAuthn (which Passkeys are built on top of) is that the chain of trust is no longer directly between a user and a remote service; instead, links are inserted by establishing a chain which includes the user’s client software (e.g. their web browser and OS) and a hardware security module (e.g. a security key like a Yubikey or an embedded module like a TPM). These new links enable the remote service to authenticate a user using methods much more secure than can be done with passwords and 6-digit SMS or TOTP codes and moves such validation to the security hardware itself via pins, biometrics, etc in a way that does not transmit such data over a network which would expose it to MITM attacks as is the case with passwords. The big assumption here is that the user trusts their software and security hardware is not compromised, but this is the same assumption that must be made regardless of how authentication is established with the remote service.

> 2fa supported passphrases don't rely on local device security. They exist separately from the device.

Still not sure what you mean here. What exactly do you mean by “passphrases?” My assumption is that you mean passwords (albeit consisting of several randomized, memorable words) that are transmitted across the network in a hashed or plaintext form to be validated by the remote service. Is this what you mean?

And what do you mean by “2FA supported passphrases?” Are you talking about the above that are backed with an additional authentication step such as WebAuthn, SMS, TOTP, etc?

> Is the argument being made that personal devices are more easily or better secured than a passphrase with 2fa? That's hard to imagine. For my critical applications my passphrase is dozens of characters long with 2fa (in one particular case, 3fa).

No, the argument is that passwords are a terrible method for performing authentication on a remote service as they are easily phished, more easily subject to MITM and replay attacks, and rely way too much on humans to provide decent security (e.g. avoiding password reuse, making them sufficiently complex, etc). Moreover, several 2FA methods are also subject to some of the same issues (SIM jacking for SMS, MITM for TOTP and SMS, etc). Furthermore, passwords require a shared secret to provide authentication (the password itself) which becomes exposed whenever there is a security breach of the remote service, adding to the toil that a user must endure to reestablish a secure method to authenticate with that service in the future (by changing their password again).

Passkeys essentially do away with ALL of those insecurities by moving the human-to-machine authentication off the network to instead be performed by hardware that the user themself controls and trusts, with the chain of trust forged with asymmetric secrets between the user’s trusted hardware and the remote service.

> It's just hard to believe that it makes sense to make my entire security strategy dependent on one device that is poorly secured with biometrics, pins or patterns.

What I read you saying here is that you don’t trust the hardware and software you control. That trust is a fundamental assumption being made for Passkeys to be secure. Hardware and software makers have their own ways to address these concerns. For example:

Yubikeys (when used for WebAuthn authentication for Passkeys) require entry of a pin and a physical touch. Failing to enter the correct pin 3 times requires removing and reinserting the key into the computer. After 8 consecutive failures, the key erases itself and the Passkeys are gone from the device. This is all predicated on the Yubikey itself being manufactured in a way that it is cost prohibitive to anyone attempting to extract the Passkeys from the key, and all cryptographic operations occur within the key itself; no private key data is ever exposed to the computers it is connected to.

> OR... is the idea that light security needs can be met this way? I could buy that. I have throwaway accounts with simple passwords that could be clearly more easily accessed with a device-based passkey.

The idea is that Passkeys both greatly increase the security of authentication by both substantially increasing the cost of attacking the most common attack surfaces in use today (where most authentication is done with passwords) and reducing the toil on users to achieve high security of their accounts.

> Hmmm.. what if you drop your device in the sewer?

Have a backup device. If you use security keys, get a second one and register it on the same accounts as your primary one. Or use an integrated ecosystem like iCloud. There are many options here, and one of the biggest pros is that most people (1) own a smartphone and (2) can use the associated ecosystem (iCloud, Google, etc) to sync their Passkeys between their devices. While these solutions are technically less secure than a hardware security key, it is a small cost for a massive increase in ease-of-use for most users.Comment 6: Password + 2FA is weaker than a passkey. The reason your password needs to be so complex is because it is stored in multiple places and is subject to a number of attack vectors that are not rate limited. A website with poor security practices could compromise your password. 

A passkey is (in a sane deployment) stored on secured hardware (a security chip) that is hardened against extraction. Even a phone with the minimum size password is extremely hard to compromise unless the victim just tells you the password. Passkeys force all attacks to be in person and require you to be passive about securing your accounts after an attack.Comment 7: Please explain what I'm misunderstanding here:

1: A device (say, a phone) provides all passkeys for a user

2: Access to any passkey is unlocked via biometric, or if the biometric isn't functioning, via a pattern (substitute any backup access mechanism you like).

3: An attacker, in an over-the-shoulder encounter (say, an airport) learns the pattern.

4: The attacker takes the phone using some subterfuge and in moments has access to EVERYTHING protected by passkeys on that phone 

Therefore, all accounts (finances, investments, communication) are easily attacked through a pattern, regardless of how secure the passkey is in itself. It seems to me that as soon as the community of attackers realizes that all these poorly protected devices open the floodgates to all the passkeys, they will become the focus of attacks. *No one ever has to defeat a passkey*, they only have to defeat the weakest device protection. 

The only accounts uncompromised are those protected independently of the device (like those protected by 2fa-supported passphrases).

What an i missing?Comment 8: The piece you're missing is that (1) this vector of attack is not unique passkeys, (2) that passkeys are non-exportable, and (3) that the surface area of attacks is vastly narrowed.

For your example, one of the things you have to assume is that the person using weak forms of phone authentication would be the sort of person to use very complex passwords with 2FA. Unlikely. 

Shoulder surfing attacks are not attacks of opportunity. Anyone dedicated enough to surveil someone enough to watch them input passwords on their phone can use the same technique for a person using passwords and 2FA. Once you have unrestricted access to someone's phone and email, your account recovery options make all your accounts vulnerable. The same applies to password managers except password manager databases are exportable and don't even require use of the phone.

The vast majority of attacks are non-local and done at large scale via MITM attacks and session hijacking. Unless you have an interest in a specific person, it's not practical to compromise a person's security by in person attacks.Comment 9: You said it much better than in my reply which I've deleted. Just one minor inaccuracy: Passkeys bound to an ecosystem may be exportable to other accounts within that ecosystem beyond the control of the original owner. For example, [iPhone users can copy Passkeys via AirDrop to other iCloud accounts](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-passkeys-passwords-securely-airdrop-iph0dd1796bb/ios). However, this still requires physical access to the victim's device which is a much higher bar than observing someone's password.Comment 10: Thank you. 
""...it's not practical ...""

That's the best answer I've heard.

So, let's say I want to use a passkey on a critical site and I need a device to implement it. Even though it isn't practical to attack my phone (or other device?) I still would not want biometric or patterns or something similar controlling access to this particular passkey. In those situations, are there any current reliable and  difficult device barriers in the works that I might be willing to trust?Comment 11: Don't forget. You can always put your passkey on a hardware security key too. So for super critical sites or services you can make the passkey non-copyable. This would be the most secure you can get. However, you now take on the job of backups and maintence (i.e. multiple yubikeys) This is what i'll do for my Proton, Microsoft, and Google accounts, etc. Everything else (e.g. dominos, Netflix, etc) go to regular old (copyable) passkeysComment 12: That's very good. I wasn't aware that was possible. I can imagine Google, Proton, my clients, and banking like that. Everything else on my phone. Very cool.

Yes, there are workarounds to get onto my Google account withoutmthe passkey, but not a fully baked solution yet.Comment 2: so I set up passkeys on my google accounts and when I tried to sign in on a different device (imac, ipad) and I scanned the QR code it would say that there is no passkey in keychain that matches that account. After signing in with yubikey it then asks me to make a passkey, i say continue and then it will say that one already exists?!

&#x200B;

So clearly passkey isn't working. I deleted the passkeys and recreated them on my iMac this time but it's the same issue when trying to sign in. I don't understand. 

&#x200B;

So far the hope and potential of passkeys have been found lacking for me :/Comment 3: It looks like it's not possible to go ""truly passwordless"" just yet. Hopefully this will be possible soon, because it's the thing I'm looking forward to the most and the first step towards towards eliminating the need for a password manager.

I enabled passkeys, then I used the Samsung Browser on a S23 Ultra, and it prompted for a password. I'd actually expect to outright not let me login on browsers that don't support passkeys yet.Comment 4: I set up Passkeys on my iPhone and then went on to login through my Windows PC. There, it prompts for login through a password than a QR. I'm not sure if it's supposed to work this way though. Shouldn't it show a QR to be scanned which I can directly scan through iPhone with Passkey enabled and get the access?Comment 5: I was able to create the Passkey successfully, and I can see it's now synced with an iCloud account across multiple devices.... but now I can't use it anywhere? I've tried to login via Chrome on Windows and macOS, and via Safari on macOS and iOS, but I can't get it to prompt for the passkey. Is there a specific combination of ecosystem, browser and OS where folks have had success?Comment 6: Bitwarden has announced they will release Passkey support soon, as they recently acquired a company focused solely on passwordless security technology.

The best idea is to wait until Bitwarden and other password managers roll out Passkey support for exactly this reason, to avoid ecosystem lock-in and the friction between different platforms. 

You *can* also use a resident key on a hardware-based security key, but this will take up memory, of which there is a finite (and typically small) amount on said devices. Yubikeys, for example, can hold about 32 resident keys, but it seems smarter to reserve that for critical logins like your password vault or primary email, and to keep the Passkeys for the bulk of your services inside a properly configured cloud vault (such as Bitwarden will be).Comment 7: Still I think it's really exciting to see that they rolled it out for all major platforms, not just AndroidComment 8: This is very similar to my experience. I was able to create passkeys, but not use them.Comment 9: On which device / OS did you create the passkeys in your first attempt?Comment 10: If you're prompted to scan the QR code sounds like the passkey didn't sync as expected in your icloud key chain to be directly available to the browser on both devices. When you scan the QR code it tries to use this proxy Bluetooth approach to use the passkey, I've used that approach a few times but I still have Q's on the implementation as it does require a brief Bluetooth connection on both devices and I assume it fails if it can't toggle Bluetooth onComment 11: [deleted]Comment 12: Did it work for you on another browser?Comment 13: Yeah, the only thing I can think of is that not all browsers have proper support for passkeys yet. When trying to log into my account on the Samsung Galaxy Browser, it also prompts for my password. Chrome and Safari work fine.

It’s annoying. This is supposed to help you go passwordless, and it’s like 99% there haha.Comment 14: I think the logic that determines when you are promoted for the passkey by default is still a little tricky, since most users have a lot of methods on their accounts. On your Windows PC the passkey would not be directly available to the browser, so it would need to use the QR code + Bluetooth proxy transfer method.Comment 15: The logic for when it prompts directly to passkey by default is still a bit of a question I think, I'm not sure what logic google uses for that, I assume it has to do with the passkeycbeing available to that browser to issue the challenge but I wonder how google is able to detect thatComment 16: Yeah. Seems like that’s going to be the case. Such a shame. Was hoping to live in a password free world but will keep using KeePassXC for now.Comment 17: I first set it up with my iPhone like the email said but that didn’t work. 2nd attempt I used my iMac. Both are running the latest OSes. iMac is an M1 and I have an iPhone 13.Comment 18: I created the passkey with Safari on macOS. I saw the passkey propagate to other devices using the iCloud keychain, but I can't use it to login anywhere else. I confirmed I can use other passkeys to sign-on to other services, just not Google.Comment 19: So what does that mean? They’re just not going to work as promised?Comment 20: hmm.. just tried again on my iMac with iphone scanning QR code but got the same result. Will have to stick with yubikey for 2FA for now. And isn't passkeys supposed to be just direct sign in instead of 2FA? So weird. I guess it's  a work in progress. So weird that so far BestBuy is the only one that I had a good result with.

PayPal is supposed to have passkey support but I can't find it anywere in account settings lol.Comment 21: It worked and prompted for passkeys on Safari and Chrome.Comment 22: As of right now I'd say to not expect them to work in all scenarios yet, while Google launched support on their side, the support for them across all the OS and browser platforms is definitely still evolving.

They should sync to devices used with that account and they have the QR  code Bluetooth method, but as you see that doesn't necessarily work.

Happy to provide more help and insights (disclaimer founded a startup in this space)Comment 11: For what it’s worth, you can select “use another device” while setting up a passkey in Chrome on macOS, and you can scan the QR code with your iPhone.

It’s early days, hopefully this stuff will shake out over time… 😅Comment 12: If you click on cancel there, it shows the other options from chrome and you can use another device.   
Since a few months Microsoft is part of the ones with the best implementations of passkeys. You don't even have to enter your email anymore to login as passkeys are unique. 

Google still asks for emails as an hybrid solution but it's not needed anymore on a full implementation that replaces passwordsComment 13: Thank you!  I didn't try signing up for a new account since I already have one, and I don't recall ever seeing the pop up at login time.  However I poked around a little more, and tried Chrome... apparently they are blocking passkeys if you are using Safari!  It also says ""This passkey will only be saved on this device"" and I verified that after being created, the passkey does not work in Safari or on other devices.  I also found that SMS 2FA is still enforced even when using passkey.

So the bottom line is that the eBay implementation has serious limitations that make it actually a worse experience than just using a password.  Unfortunately not useful at all for me as a Safari user.

Anyway, thanks again for your help, I appreciate it!Comment 14: today I noticed my Pixel Password Manager is now recommending adding passkeys I assume it is plucking off the Passkey directory the OP mentions. (this is definitely cool!)

adding a Passkey worked great w KAYAK and BestBuy - secured in an instant & awesome they are helping pave the way!

eBay is a whole other pickle.  I read yr blog post & whatever Android 14 is expecting and what eBay.com is reporting don't seem to jive.  

I've previously enabled biometrics for eBay maybe 2 months ago yet Google Password Manager still doesn't show a key for eBay stored.

the general gist of your post seems to allude to the fact that eBay may have their own custom implementation?

not the case w eBay.

where is eBay storing the key on my phone then?Comment 15: Playing with passkeys settings on this demo site https://webauthn.me/debugger (which is really well explained with animations and opensource), you can see that the ""residentKey"" is an option that a site can use to force the passkey to be a ""device bound"" one, preventing it from syncing to other devices.

So it's a choice of the site itself for increased security.

11f0jmc,Any question on Passkeys?,"Hi guys, 

I have been really intrigued by the recent changes in the authentication process of major websites. Would love to know your thoughts and concerns on passkeys. Do you think, it solves the auth problem across industries?",Adventurous_Meet9560,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/11f0jmc/any_question_on_passkeys/,,,"Comment 1: I'm looking forward to widespread adoption of Passkeys. I think it will reduce sign-up friction, and reduce tech support issues from users forgetting their credentials. 

I have already seen some inconsistency in the few sites that support Passkeys.  In some cases, you can just click ""sign in with a Passkey"", and you're done. In other cases you must enter a username or email address first. It would be nice if that were not required. 

From a user's perspective, the use of Passkeys looks a lot like ""sign in with Google"" or ""sign in with Apple"", which IMHO, are already pretty good options. 

Personally, I'm concerned about platform lock-in. There needs to be some way to port a user's passkeys, say, out of Apple, and into Google. Since this probably won't happen easily, I'm also looking forward to Passkey support from 3rd party password managers. 

I'm also concerned about browser support. Will I have to use a specific browser? Again, I'm hoping that 3rd party plug-ins will make the support universal.Comment 2: Absolutely and since I am our family IT guy I sometimes see the passwords used by people. Usually quite simple and used over and over again. And for some reason people are afraid for 2fa totp. So my hopes are on passkeys because they are easy to use and so much more secure.Comment 3: >In some cases, you can just click ""sign in with a Passkey"", and you're done.

Do you have any examples of this? I didn't know it was possible. It would definitely be easier from a user perspective.Comment 4: I think Passkeys are in-built with support for cross-devices and cross-platforms. Once you have account on one device, you can login to other device using QR scan (same like we do for whatsapp web version). Here is a link of video explaining it. [Youtube link](https://youtu.be/SWocv4BhCNg?t=227)

I agree that certain browsers like Mozilla still do not support Passkeys. But seeing all Big Techs (Google, Apple. Microsoft) leading the Passkey group, soon all OS, browsers should be compatible.Comment 5: yes, from a user point of view, This could be really helpful. As it will give a smooth and simpler function for all, at the same time secure.Comment 6: At the demo site, [passkeys.io](https://passkeys.io), you need to enter an email to sign up initially, but when you return, you don't need to type in an email. You can just click ""Sign in with a passkey"".  MacOS (Safari) then prompted something like ""Do you want to sign in with the passkey for (my email address)""?  So, it is capable of remembering the user's email that was used to create the passkey in the first place... So, why should I ever have to type it when signing in again?Comment 7: You can check out, [passkeylab.com](https://passkeylab.com) to see how this works. Once you login, you can just sign in with passkeys.Comment 8: This is possible because passkeys are unique compared to passwords that can be used by mutliple users. So we can identify users just by their passkey, no email is needed except for recovery, login with a code sent to the email or notifications purpose

But now the correct implementation is up to each site or third party login service.

Microsoft did it well but not Google for example.

I have been really intrigued by the recent changes in the authentication process of major websites. Would love to know your thoughts and concerns on passkeys. Do you think, it solves the auth problem across industries?Comment 1: I'm looking forward to widespread adoption of Passkeys. I think it will reduce sign-up friction, and reduce tech support issues from users forgetting their credentials. 

I have already seen some inconsistency in the few sites that support Passkeys.  In some cases, you can just click ""sign in with a Passkey"", and you're done. In other cases you must enter a username or email address first. It would be nice if that were not required. 

From a user's perspective, the use of Passkeys looks a lot like ""sign in with Google"" or ""sign in with Apple"", which IMHO, are already pretty good options. 

Personally, I'm concerned about platform lock-in. There needs to be some way to port a user's passkeys, say, out of Apple, and into Google. Since this probably won't happen easily, I'm also looking forward to Passkey support from 3rd party password managers. 

I'm also concerned about browser support. Will I have to use a specific browser? Again, I'm hoping that 3rd party plug-ins will make the support universal.Comment 2: Absolutely and since I am our family IT guy I sometimes see the passwords used by people. Usually quite simple and used over and over again. And for some reason people are afraid for 2fa totp. So my hopes are on passkeys because they are easy to use and so much more secure.Comment 3: >In some cases, you can just click ""sign in with a Passkey"", and you're done.

Do you have any examples of this? I didn't know it was possible. It would definitely be easier from a user perspective.Comment 4: I think Passkeys are in-built with support for cross-devices and cross-platforms. Once you have account on one device, you can login to other device using QR scan (same like we do for whatsapp web version). Here is a link of video explaining it. [Youtube link](https://youtu.be/SWocv4BhCNg?t=227)

I agree that certain browsers like Mozilla still do not support Passkeys. But seeing all Big Techs (Google, Apple. Microsoft) leading the Passkey group, soon all OS, browsers should be compatible.Comment 5: yes, from a user point of view, This could be really helpful. As it will give a smooth and simpler function for all, at the same time secure.Comment 6: At the demo site, [passkeys.io](https://passkeys.io), you need to enter an email to sign up initially, but when you return, you don't need to type in an email. You can just click ""Sign in with a passkey"".  MacOS (Safari) then prompted something like ""Do you want to sign in with the passkey for (my email address)""?  So, it is capable of remembering the user's email that was used to create the passkey in the first place... So, why should I ever have to type it when signing in again?Comment 7: You can check out, [passkeylab.com](https://passkeylab.com) to see how this works. Once you login, you can just sign in with passkeys.Comment 8: This is possible because passkeys are unique compared to passwords that can be used by mutliple users. So we can identify users just by their passkey, no email is needed except for recovery, login with a code sent to the email or notifications purpose

But now the correct implementation is up to each site or third party login service.

Microsoft did it well but not Google for example. On Google you still need to enter your email firstComment 9: At the first instance you might have to enter the email address or phone number, this user flow is stated by the company that is implementing passkeys. This is required for sending out campaigns or newsletters.

2. eBay will not use the passkey I created on my desktop. It always asks me for my password and then asks me if I want to setup a passkey
3. The Kayak app can't use a passkey to authenticate. Only the website. The app keeps wanting to email me a ""magic link,"" which it can't do because I created a passkey.

This is my stance as well. I'm not going to give up control of my credentials to Google or Apple. I will use them only when/if I'm able to manage them myself, use them on any device easily, and back them up to a local file.

But Passkeys work on WebAuthn spec which is different. When you try to log in into a website the server sends you a challenge which only you can digitally sign with your private key. When the server receives the signatur, it verifies it with your public key which they stored during registration. If it is a valid signature you are authenticated.

Google’s current authentication implementation for Google accounts does not support it for passwordless authentication. It’s still UserID Password or Notification to your phone based Authentication neither of them protects you from phishing attacks.

If you add a simple password to your Google account and just used Passkey/Security Key as your 2FA. It is technically phishing proof and secure enough but an attack can still do social engineering attack on Google support posing as you to reset your easy password and do some damage.

I use yubikey on my main account and since that account is [firstnamelastname@gmail.com](mailto:firstnamelastname@gmail.com), i probably won't be able to switch to this without getting frequent alerts, but this would be awesome to log in anywhere without worrying about password getting stolen.Comment 7: I just activated mine too. I'm guessing you have to have it on at least 2 devices nowComment 8: Great to see that it's finally available in an easy way for all accountsComment 9: Account settings, security, log in with email. Next page will explain how it worksComment 10: [deleted]Comment 11: You are able to log in without password?Comment 12: Yes this is still a OTP/Notification based Authentication where the Relying Party in this case Google sends a notification or OPT to a registered device and you just tap “Yes” and it logs you in.

But Passkeys work on WebAuthn spec which is different. When you try to log in into a website the server sends you a challenge which only you can digitally sign with your private key. When the server receives the signatur, it verifies it with your public key which they stored during registration. If it is a valid signature you are authenticated.

Google’s current authentication implementation for Google accounts does not support it for passwordless authentication. It’s still UserID Password or Notification to your phone based Authentication neither of them protects you from phishing attacks.

If you add a simple password to your Google account and just used Passkey/Security Key as your 2FA. It is technically phishing proof and secure enough but an attack can still do social engineering attack on Google support posing as you to reset your easy password and do some damage.

If you use same email/username in a bunch of websites and account and anyone of them were breached in the past your email is in the hands of an attacker they can bombard you with notification requests or contact support in your name to get access to your account.Comment 13: I have six Yubikeys and an iCloud account with passkeys configured for all of my Google accounts (gmail and workplace).Comment 14: Okay, I’ve gone to the security settings page and I don’t see anything that says “log in with email.” This is on a Chrome browser on macOS.Comment 15: That's 2fa. Shouldn't it be the one under log in with email?Comment 16: I’m trying this on iPhone, iPad and in a Mac with the Chrome browser and I don’t see anything about Passkeys on the 2-step verification page.Comment 17: [deleted]Comment 18: What you said make sense. I went back and tested [https://webauthn.io/](https://webauthn.io/) again, and yes, there is no password for that. I guess I just have to wait.

You can test it on WebAuthn.ioComment 23: I guess they haven't implemented it as it should then. You should be able to just give your email and get prompt on phone. There are a few demo pages where it works like thatComment 24: Yes

https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790319-How-many-accounts-can-I-register-my-YubiKey-with-Comment 25: Mine looks similar except I don’t have anything that says ‘Use your phone to sign in’ but I also have 2-step verification enabled whereas you don’t. Maybe that’s why. I still don’t see where it says ‘log in with email’ in your screen capture.Comment 26: Yes, you can't have passkeys when 2FA is enabled. That is mentioned in the article.Comment 27: So I disable 2-step verification and I still don’t see anything that says ‘Passkeys’ but the screen now looks like the screen shot you posted.

I tried the ‘Use your phone to sign in’ but that prompts me to download the Google app which I don’t want to do so I just re-enabled the 2-step verification.

As far as I’m concerned they still don’t have passkey support for Google accounts.Comment 28: Thanks for trying. I would have to agree with you, it is not really supported 100%"

z2w7rb,A directory of websites that support the use of Passkeys.,,gcerullo,https://passkeys.directory,,,"Comment 1: So I checkout the list and tried setting up Passkeys with some sites where I already had accounts.

eBay: I posted earlier that I set up Passkeys on my eBay account and that was very easy.

Paypal: I looked everywhere in the account settings and for the life of me I could not find where to set up Passkeys. If anyone figures this one out let me know.

Google: I’m not sure where to set up Passkeys on Google. I thought it might be ‘Security Key’ which had me download something called ‘Google Smart Lock’ to my phone to enable it but that just set up another way to do 2-step verification which I already do using the YouTube app on my iPhone/iPad. Even their 2-step verification doesn’t work with the built-in Password Manager on Apple devices.

Microsoft: Like Google I’m not sure where to set this up. The wording is not clear and the only thing I could find that might be Passkeys wanted me to download Microsoft Authenticator. I’m not downloading additional software to use a feature that is already built in to the iPhone.

Very disappointed so far. If anyone figures these out I’d like to know how to set these up.Comment 2: Best Buy was really easy for me. 

For Google tho, I went back to using the verification code in Settings > Passwords on iOS. Relying on a second app is a mess.Comment 3: I thought Apple has it.Comment 4: Since yesterday, Google is supporting it and it is very easy.

Microsoft also supports it since a few months :)

But for now we can not delete the password yet on Google, we can do that only on MicrosoftComment 5: [deleted]Comment 6: I just tried Google and even though I was able to setup Passkeys it still asks for my password when I sign in. If I try on another device it tells me Passkeys is already set up but it still won’t use it for signing in. Still wants me to enter a password. Seems they still have work to do on their implementation.

As for Microsoft it still asks me to download their authenticator app before I can even try to set up any alternative method of authentication.

Not looking good so far!Comment 7: Probably a little late to the game but here’s what I found:

1. Passkeys basically fill in the spot of a security key. So when a website offers to use a security key for login you can setup a passkey instead when using a chromium based browser or safari.
2. As I understand it, Google only supports security keys and therefore passkeys for 2-step-verification which means you still need your email and password.
3. Microsoft only lets you set up a security key when you are on the account page with a windows desktop pc using a chromium based browser.
4. Paypal supports passkeys currently in the US and only the US. Don’t know where you’re from. Should come to other countries this year.Comment 8: I never encountered any of those issues, it may be browser related but on chrome it worked perfectly from the beginning.

For Microsoft you need that app as a backup method to be able to delete your password.

It seems like a great way for both of them to lock people into their ecosystems. It's not hard to imagine a future where an iPhone user can't switch to Android because hundreds of passkeys are locked into iCloud Keychain.

I'm really hoping 1Password can push other players into making passkeys as interoperable as passwords. Seems like they're also thinking about this.
https://www.future.1password.com/passkeys/Comment 3: I understand the point but considering how new this technology is, I'm not surprised that Google/Apple/Microsoft don't have a way to export.  For one, it is just much easier to create a new key on your other device, than to export/transfer/import your key. Would it be in a flat file? Encrypted or not encrypted?

Reason two for not letting users export the key: novice users will do this and their keys will get compromised.  If you are inexperienced at security, and you see that ""Export"" menu option, 1 in 20 users will do it just to do it, and now their secrets are just sitting on the disk unencrypted.

Reason three, there is also a level of trust between the website and the keychain maker, that they promise the user will always be physically present, will always have to unlock the keychain in whatever way they did the first time, etc.  As a site owner like Google or Paypal, I might choose not to support PIN unlock or not to support LastPass as a keychain maker, or only require Yubikey, etc.  The keychain vendor and the website relying on it are having a side conversation. Allowing you to export will basically break their promise to the web site owners.

Finally, yes it is true that they want you to stay in the walled garden, and though I don't think they lose anything if you use multiple keychains, it just makes their product harder to support because interoperability is now a feature they have to test, and their support calls will grow based on problems from the other vendors.  

All that said... I'm sure that export will be an option down the line, maybe not with the big 3, but others like Bitwarden almost certainly will.  And people will happily back up and migrate their keys (and more keys will get compromised since they are stored unencrypted).  It's off limits now for the same reason TOTP was hiding the key from you when it was new.

I would still encourage everyone (even power users like yourself) to make a new key each time you have a new keychain rig.  It's usually easier than exporting, and later you can decide to rotate/invalidate keys when your phone gets stolen, and you get to keep rocking with the keys on your other platform or your Yubikey or whatever.  (In fact Yubikey is the only one I'm 100% confident will never be exportable). For most use cases creating a new key solves the problem without creating more problems.

Good luck!Comment 4: If I understand passkeys correctly ... (big IF) ... 1st level verification is on one's device (either faceID or touchID). The scenario all the promo videos show is simple – you have your own device and you're using it to login to a site using passkeys. 

A more complicated scenario is if you happen to be using a public device when you try to log into a site. I gather you'll be prompted for your faceID or touchID on your primary device(s). Once you've done that you can carry on using that other device. 

So, in either scenario, the first resort AND last resort is identification on one's personal device(s). This seems to lock us even more closely to our devices.

What if one wants to make a digital upheaval like switching from iOS to Android? Is it possible to migrate keys from one OS to another?

Now, what if after the industry is all using passkeys, one decides to ditch the smart phone for a dumb phone? Or, what if one is burgled and no longer has access to his/her primary identification devices? 
Do they become outcasts, shunned by society?Comment 5: Yes.

If we give up our keys, we are definitely in the hands of big (states) companies. 

P.S. I like what I saw in that video.Comment 7: Anyone knows how to export passkeys from Google Chrome password manager? Is that even possible? They are not included in an export from the password manager...Comment 8: This is my take on it.

Ultimately, you own your credentials but my understanding on 'portability' is that it's more complicated now. Take for example 2-factor authentication. If you want to use another app (for example move from 1Password to Bitwarden) to generate 2FA codes you have to log in to each service and re-register the other app as the one that generates the codes.

With Passkeys you would have to log in to each service and create new keys with the app you want to move to. You would think that moving keys from one app to another would be easier but there might be security considerations involved in doing that.Comment 9: You are mistaken.

TOTP (2FA) are perfectly portable. The problem is some apps make it non-portable (Authy). 2FA- TOTP has a key, you can check it in 1Password, Bitwarden, Apple keychain (edit: Mac only)...

This is 100% wrong. TOTP secrets are just plaintext. A lot of places encode them as a QR code, but it's just text. If you look around the page with the QR code, you'll see a link that says something like ""Enter manually"". If you click that link you'll see a string of letters. That's your TOTP secret key. It's just text. Glorious, portable, text.

The fact that certain authenticator apps don't let you export or see this text is just evil. They're trying to lock you in.

Now, when I just logged in to eBay.ca (Canada) it did not use Passkey login. When I went to my account settings ‘Sign in and Security’ page I got an error saying the page did not exist.

So I just signed in to eBay.com (USA site) and I was presented once again with the same question to set up Passkey sign in and I did.

Now when I go the settings page for ‘Sign in and Security’ I see the settings for ‘Face/fingerprint/PIN’ sign in.

Look for those settings in your account if you were not prompted to set it up during your initial sign in.

Make sure you are using a browser that supports it. On Mac that is Safari and possible Chrome. On Windows Chrome supports it but I’m not sure about Edge.

EDIT: Just signed back in to eBay.ca and was asked to set up Passkey again. It was like I never set it up.

Now, when I just logged in to eBay.ca (Canada) it did not use Passkey login. When I went to my account settings ‘Sign in and Security’ page I got an error saying the page did not exist.

So I just signed in to eBay.com (USA site) and I was presented once again with the same question to set up Passkey sign in and I did.

Now when I go the settings page for ‘Sign in and Security’ I see the settings for ‘Face/fingerprint/PIN’ sign in.

Look for those settings in your account if you were not prompted to set it up during your initial sign in.

Make sure you are using a browser that supports it. On Mac that is Safari and possible Chrome. On Windows Chrome supports it but I’m not sure about Edge.

EDIT: Just signed back in to eBay.ca and was asked to set up Passkey again. It was like I never set it up.

Seems like eBay still has bugs in their implementation."
