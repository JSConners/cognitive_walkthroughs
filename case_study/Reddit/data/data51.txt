Comment 1: The breakage actually comes from Safari 17.4(!). With Firefox 124 still running, and without rebooting, I downloaded the available Safari 17.4.1, retried passkeys in Firefox and now they work.

  
The whole passkeys popup dialogue comes from Safari, apparently.Comment 2: Yes no oneâ€™s allowed to have bugs or make mistakes ðŸ™„
