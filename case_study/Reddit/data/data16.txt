Comment 1: I think youâ€™re confusing two factor codes with passkeys.

because until MS releases an Authenticstor update passkeys do not work from the phone to desktop the way you want

instead they sync to compatible desktop software. and only that wayComment 2: Is this a new update? The reason I ask is because when I had a Pixel 6A and Pixel 8 this is exactly how it worked. I could sign into my Google account on the desktop while using the passkey on my phone.  I used it multiple times in fact. On the Pixel there were only issues with it in the beginning but then it was fixed. 


But with the Samsung Galaxy s24+ however now it seems like as you mentioned that I can't use my passkey on my phone to access my Google account on the desktop.Comment 3: [https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S24/Issue-with-pass-keys/td-p/2840700](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S24/Issue-with-pass-keys/td-p/2840700)

based on this you should move to synced passkeysComment 4: I'm so sorry if this seems like a "duh" question but I clicked the link but I don't really understand how can I move to sync passkeys? Is there a tutorial on how to do that? Any information about this would be greatly appreciated.Comment 5: You canâ€™t move passkeys yet. Â Would need to delete and remake them on each websiteÂ Comment 6: In that case how would one delete their passkey for their phone and make another one when I thought ðŸ¤” on Android Google makes a passkey automatically? I'm not sure how to delete a passkey for my Google account.Comment 7: you would go to the website and delete it from there

also, it canâ€™t make one automatically.  The process is initiated by the siteComment 8: I see. I'll try that and see if it works. Thank you for letting me know. Appreciate it
