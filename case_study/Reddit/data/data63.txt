Make sure to scroll a little bit and you will find link to small tool that wil make deletion of your keys easier. Helped me at least.

EDIT: There you go - https://github.com/passwordless/webauthn-fido2-key-removerComment 2: Wow. Thanks. This is very useful.

What I did was remove the Windows PIN and add it again. This removed all the saved passkeys.

I then set them up again and now there are only working passkeys, but this method is way better.

Thanks again.
