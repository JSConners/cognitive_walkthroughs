Comment 1: I'm not sure what the issue is. Are you expecting it to go directly to your PIN/Bio? If so, that's how Amazon has set it up. It seems you can choose where to store your passkey, and the first option should lead to the PIN/Bio prompt of your Windows. Unfortunately, you can't change these settings; it's managed on Amazon's side.Comment 2: It's probably an issue from Passkeys implementations not yet being ready for productionComment 3: This is an implementation issue of Amazon, their passkey implementation is not really covering edge cases. So Windows 10 is the weakest link in passkey at the moment, because the platform authenticator is very old and does not support mobile phones. 

You can use passkeys (platform authenticator) on any windows device that has a PIN. Biometrics are always a shortcut to avoid entering the PIN. This is also true on all mobile phones, e.g. Face-ID is only a shortcut to not enter the Passcode.

Whenever you want to Set-Up or Login with Passkey on Windows 10 and you see the "Security Key" message, somebody messed up on the provide side. So you are very likely not lazy.Comment 4: [deleted]Comment 5: Ah, I see now. For some reason, Amazon is requiring a cross-platform passkey for Windows 11. This means you can only use a security key or other devices (like a phone) to create a passkey. It might be a bug on Amazon's side, or perhaps they want users to create a passkey on mobile first. It's hard to say, but based on how it worked in Windows 10, it might be a bug.Comment 6: Have you tried clicking more choices?Comment 7: [deleted]Comment 8: Damn. well not much you can do at this point, but to create the passkey on your phone. Personally, I like it this way cause then you can sign in on pretty much any device with QR code. You can always create another passkey on your Windows 11 when they have it enabled or fixed.
