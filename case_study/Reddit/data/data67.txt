Comment 1: I can't answer your question but I would suggest using a Yubikey over the Titan if you haven't already bought a key.Comment 2: Pixel has a Titan Security chip built in, so you can use both to access your accounts.Comment 3: Why? Can a Yubikey store as many passkeys as a Titan?Comment 4: Thanks, but my question is a littel different, can I use either my phone or Titan key to access  one of my accounts?Comment 5: Can he use the pixel if he loses his pixel?Comment 6: Trouble with Titan is that you can't view or manage the resident keys stored in them. Once a credential is inside it can only be removed by resetting all of the credentials.Comment 7: Correct, so you can use your phone most of the time and keep a Titan key as a backup.Comment 8: >Can he use the pixel if he loses his pixel?

No, but he could use the Titan.Comment 9: No, they're device-bound.
