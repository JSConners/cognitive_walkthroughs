Comment 1: I have a problem when trying to use my phone for cross-device authentication.  Passkeys work fine if I sign in directly from my phone, but if I try to sign in on a different device I get the popup on my phone but the other device fails immediately with "Something went wrong" before I have a chance to confirm authentication on my phone (thumbprint scan).

I've tried testing different sites and on different devices with the same result.  I suspect it must be something with my phone (Android 12) but I don't have another one to test with.  There's not a lot of troubleshooting info out there right now, so hopefully you might have some ideas.Comment 2: Which operating system and browser (+versions) does the other device (the client, not your Android) have?Comment 3: I have the same issue. commenting for any solution at a later dateComment 4: Windows 11 Pro (22H2) with Firefox (122.0). Also tried Chrome (121.0.6167.140) with the same result.Comment 5: On your Windows device, do you have Bluetooth?Comment 6: Yes, if I disable it on the Windows device I get a prompt to re-enable Bluetooth temporarily.  Oddly it still connects if Bluetooth is disabled on the phone but still has data or wifi (prompt on the phone and 'Device Connected' on Windows).
