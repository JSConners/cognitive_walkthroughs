Comment 1: No. The QR code is meant to be scanned by mobile devices. You can scan the QR code with your laptop, but it wouldn't know how to process it. Plus the experience with scanning the QR code with your laptop is kinda awkward lol.Comment 2: A bit off topic : You can store a passkey in a password manager like 1Password, Bitwarden or Dashland ( There are more.) You can do this on your laptop and sign in using the password manager on any other device including your mobile phone. Provided the OS is new enough.Comment 3: That’s not the intended way since scanning a QR code with your laptop would be at least a bit awkward or even impossible. Note that if you store the passkey on a Mac, it will be available on your iPhone/iPad immediately if the devices are signed in to the same iCloud account. Using one of the major password managers also solves this issue. 

We can expect more interoperability between passkey/credential providers in the future, e.g. connecting your Google Password Manager account to your Mac‘s Keychain and the like.Comment 4: do you have a surface device with a back camera which makes it easier for you to try this?  
windows might not support the protocol/scheme in the QR code for prompting passkey authentication. From what I know Windows passkeys are device bound and not sure if they support cross device authentication.Comment 5: That is not an expected use case. Intended clients and authenticators for CDA are listed in the matrix at https://passkeys.dev/device-support/

I suggest watching https://youtu.be/SWocv4BhCNg?feature=shared to see how CDA flow is expected to be used.Comment 6: Need help here. I have scanned the QR Code with the phone on windows 11 and checked - "Skip the QR code next time? Your devices can remember each other." Now on Windows 11 my phone appear always as "Other Device". I understand from here [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows) that now the devices are "Linked Devices". BUT how can I unlink those devices again?
