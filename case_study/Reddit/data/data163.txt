Comment 1: 1) At least the encrypted private key. The public key only needs to be stored by the remote service that the Passkey was created for.

2) The private key doesnâ€™t leave the device in the Passkey auth workflow because it is only used for signing (which happens on-device). It never leaves the device in plaintext, but it **must** leave the device in some form to work with iCloud.
