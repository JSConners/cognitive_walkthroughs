Comment 1: used it though?Comment 2: Bitwarden can be added to your list and I think 1Pass does too.Comment 3: What good is switching to a passkey if the website still uses passwords and your password is still saved on their site? They can still be hacked and the hackers can still get your data.Comment 4: Thx. Nice to forward to security responsibles.Comment 5: Cannot find the settings for passkey in bitwardenComment 6: Agree, but is will be a temporary periode until passkeys becomes better adopted - then collecting and storing username/password combinations will (hopefully) vanish...Comment 7: It's available now!Comment 8: It's planned. Bitwarden has taken over Passwordless.dev for this very purpose. Keepass apps are also making progress on this.Comment 9: Only in browser extension though. Hope it comes soon too Android and iOS apps.
