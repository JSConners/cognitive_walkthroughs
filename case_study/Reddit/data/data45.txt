Comment 1: Yes. And you can even use a security key plugged in your phone to login on your computer through the hybrid protocol (I've just tried it).

That being said, device-bound passkeys don't exist natively on either Android or iOS: they are synced with Google/Apple ID. So it would require a 3rd-party passkey provider keeping the passkeys locally.Comment 2: That would not be a bad idea. An app which handles the passkey locally on the mobile phone and in such a way that the private key never leaves the device.Comment 3: Although the *default* configuration of both Apple and Google passkeys are multi-device (synced), I thought that the relying party (website or app) can (by policy) specify which type they support. And when the passkey is created by the device, there is a flag that indicates whether the passkey can or cannot be shared via secure transport to the service providerâ€™s cloud ID platform (ie is single-device or multi-device).Comment 4: And thank you for your reply!Comment 5: I think the relying party can specify which type they support (admit I could be wrong here), but that does mean they can make iOS or Android support something that is not implemented.
