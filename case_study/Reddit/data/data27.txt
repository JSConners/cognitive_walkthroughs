Comment 1: For whatever the relying party that asks to create the passkey, is there an option to add another passkey? Normally the website would have a section where for your user account you can view settings for security and choose to add / remove passkeys as appropriate.

If it allows additional passkeys you can try the flow and see if it lets you scan a qr code to do the hybrid flow where credential lives on the phone. At this point you can login using passkey on PC and passkey on the phone.

Then when it comes to accessing the same site/app on your phone if they allow using a passkey you can use the one provisioned earlier on the phone.

You can test this process using https://passkeys.io to get an idea of what I mean.Comment 2: Oh my god you saved me! I had been trying to set up a passkey on my google account instead and it kept failing, I hadn't even thought of setting one up on onelogin

It worked! Thank you so much!
