Comment 1: You need to have Bluetooth enabled btw to allow the browser to connect to your phone as a security key. You've got all that correctly set up as well on the Windows 10 machine?Comment 2: How has your transition to pass keys been?Comment 3: Press cancel and then a new popup appears with your device as a choiceComment 4: Ohh, I need bluetooth! Ok, that's never gonna work then. It was a VMComment 5: Nope, that doesn't happen. Pressing cancel goes straight into "something went wrong" page of the Google loginComment 6: >You need to have Bluetooth enabled btw to allow the browser to connect to your phone as a security key.

yes if the passkey is in a different machine, the flow needs to verify the device with the passkey is in close proximity to the device requesting the passkey login flow, so its not going to work by scanning a QR code or security key if you are remoting on to a different VM from a host machine.  
The other way to get passkey to work on VMs would be to use a password manager like 1Password/Bitwarden which support storing passkeys.Comment 7: Try Google Chrome?Comment 8: thanks. I guess ill stick to using a password + TOTP 2FA.  
I was really hoping that i would be able to login to any computer, even remote ones, by typing my email and then approving a prompt on my phoneComment 9: Unless you decided to run a passkey to open your password manager.Comment 10: Same result. I wonder if it's because it's an older machine running windows 10?
I tried on a windows 11 machine and it worked, I saw the option to use my phone.Comment 11: A unique password with TOTP 2FA is still better than most people.Comment 12: I have Windows 10 and it works for me on Chrome but it's good if you got it working on Windows 11.
