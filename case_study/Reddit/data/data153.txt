Comment 1: Update: As of today's update this has been resolved for Firefox 116.0.3 on Windows :-)Comment 2: I don’t think Firefox is supported yet. It’s why we will still have the password for a few years.

“Check what you need to create a passkey
You can create passkeys on these devices:

A laptop or desktop that runs at least Windows 10, macOS Ventura, or ChromeOS 109
A mobile device that runs at least iOS 16 or Android 9
A hardware security key that supports the FIDO2 protocol
Your computer or mobile device will also need a supported browser like:

Chrome 109 or up
Safari 16 or up
Edge 109 or up
To create and use a passkey, your device must have the following enabled:

Screen lock
Bluetooth
If you want to use a passkey on a phone to sign in to another computer
Tip: To ensure the best passkeys experience, we recommend you update to the latest available releases for your operating system.

Depending on your operating system and browser, you may not be able to create or use passkeys while in private browsing mode like incognito or other equivalent.”Comment 3: Same question here:

If, on my Mac, I login to gmail in a Chrome "new incognito" tab, I see all my Passkeys (all Android devices+ 1 osX). I select one, give my fingerprint and ok.

No need for 2FA or password. Great and secure1

Safari gives a QR to be pictured  by Iphone which I do not haveComment 4: FWIW - this worked on a Mac I never update that had Firefox 114. Upgraded it to latest version and that works too. On my windows pc only Chrome works.Comment 5: What? I dont understand this Reply?
