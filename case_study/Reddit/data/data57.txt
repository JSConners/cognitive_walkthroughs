Comment 1: Google won't ask again after you've setup at least one passkey. Also Google only asks after you have just logged in to a Google account that has no passkeys set up.

You're really looking at this wrong. What should really be going through your mind is how did you just let someone get your password so that they could just log into your google account and make changes at will.Comment 2: Yes, if someone gets into your account they can make a passkey with their device and their pin.

I would suggest you to first revoke all devices, then change password, then set up 2fa and passkeysComment 3: Is your computer Windows or Mac?Comment 4: I didn't, I just get worried about the possibility of someone somehow getting my password and not having an extra protection that allows me to stop them from doing further damage, hope that clears it up a bit!Comment 5: Alright, thanks for the advice!Comment 6: My computer is WindowsComment 7: That's why passkeys were invented - to fix the pesky flaws of passwords like having to remember them, having to make a strong one that someone won't guess, and having to make sure you don't give them to the wrong person among other things.

With Google, a passkey won't require 2FA but using your password will require 2FA, as it always has, if you have 2FA setup. It goes without saying, even when using 2FA you need to have a strong secure password that you don't give out to anyone just like you would if you weren't using 2FA.Comment 8: If someone gets your Google account password then they would probably be able to login, but if they got your Windows password it should prompt for the PIN.
