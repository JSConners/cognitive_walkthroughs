Comment 1: No credentials can withstand a gun to the head scenario. Passkeys prevent password brute force attacks and phishing attacks.Comment 2: Apple has been working on this problem. Hereâ€™s a nice discussion about [Stolen Device Protection in iOS 17.4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/03/05/ios-174-apples-game-changing-new-iphone-update-is-suddenly-here/) (which was released yesterday).Comment 3: Passkeys or not, if you have a password manager on your phone it needs protection with a secondary PIN that is independent of the device passcode.  You then hope the thief isn't astute enough to ask for that PIN as well.Comment 4: Always consider the B's:

* ***Blackmail*** - because the hacker has evidence of an act you do not want to be known.
* ***Beating*** - because as much as you believe you're brave, pain persuades you otherwise.
* ***Bribe*** - because breaching security has been made a bountiful benefit.
* ***Bonehead***  - because a copy of the string that's key to all your identities is in your wallet.
* ***Bullet*** - because dying to keep a secret is nearly always not worth it.
* ***Beer*** - because drunks have been known to forget where they parked.
* ***Butt Play*** -  because entropy & key-space are irrelevant if an intruder intends a hot lead enema

almost forgot...

* ***BullShot*** - because Phil from IT is on the phone in panic screaming of a system hack and he must change all passwords instantly.Comment 5: Silicon Valley doesn't make products that address physical security, that's my thoughts on it.

Wallets are not safe in high theft areas but it's quite easy to effectively reduce the chances that your wallet would be stolen. The same can be applied to any other physical item you have. This is nothing new, it's old hat - people have been deterring and preventing theft of property for hundreds of years. Maybe get off the Google and ask an old person how they kept their possessions from getting stolen all these years.Comment 6: Then don't use a PIN? Aren't there other methods to unlock your phone? Like fingerprint, hard to remember swipe patterns, face recognition? I am not even sure if you could setup passkeys if you only have a PINComment 7: With Passkey on a smartphone lock with biometrics they don't even need a gun

Just punching you unconsious and unlock it with your finger is enough. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. You can even trick them by threating them for a drink until they pass out.Comment 8: Thanks, I'll keep my individual passwords then. I've been through gun to the head situation more than twice in my hometown.Comment 9: Yes, I do have a password manager with a different PIN. Thanks anyway!Comment 10: How can you do this with 1password?Comment 11: I own an iPhone 13 and use Face ID but itâ€™s mandatory to have a PIN code as a backup as far as I know.Comment 12: Gun to the head is only one threat. Passkeys are also phishing resistant, so even if they donâ€™t reduce the risk of being violently compelled to divulge a secret, they do significantly reduce risk in other scenarios. Oneâ€™s overall vulnerability and thus risk would be lower with Passkeys vs passwords.Comment 13: What city?Comment 14: Okay and how would they get your face, when they are away from you? You have to authenticate again when actually using a passkey. It isn't enough to unlock your phone onesComment 15: Sounds like Gotham cityComment 16: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. A fairly common crime here is 2 armed men that approach pedestrians and force them to give their PIN codes before getting away in bikes, in which they can easily disrupt the traffic jams and get from a busy location to the shady slums really fast.

With their PIN codes, they usually try to access bank apps to make transactions or commit other sort of frauds such as getting loans on the behalf of the victim. They may also use Messenger and WhatsApp to ask victims' friends and family for money.

That's why I use individual passwords so if my phone gets stolen along with my PIN code, they won't be able to do much harm. It already happened once to me and fortunately, they failed to access my apps due this.Comment 17: They'd use the backup PIN code that's is asked on iPhone if Face ID won't work. As I said I think that there's no way to exclusively keep Face ID as the only way to unlock the phone.Comment 18: SÃ£o Paulo is pretty much like Gotham in many ways, mainly considering that is based on 80's New York. Even our National Theatre which holds our State Orchestra performances strongly resembles the one where the Wayne's parents were murdered as it is now located in a crackhead dominated Skidrow-like neighborhood.Comment 19: Wait...Doesn't Stolen Device Protection help a little with this?  That scenario is more violent of course but, as described, is similar to the shoulder surfing thief who sees you enter your passcode then steals your phone later.

In any case, the problem is falling back to device PIN when the face is not recognized. This feature should be disabled \[by Apple or companies\] for any critical feature or app on the device where comprise would be damaging.Comment 20: Well I am not familiar with iPhones. Simply try it out and if you think that would be unsafe in your situation, don't use it. It's still an option for nowComment 21: The original Gotham City goes back to December 1940 when it appeared in the "Batman #4" comic book.Comment 22: I'm using Stolen Device Protection since it was launched and it seems to be the best way to protect our devices for now. I was just reading more about passkeys because of the recent Playstation launch.Comment 23: I feel that we need something like the 5 x power button presses, that wipes the phone instantly. A self destruct button that the only recovery is to go and buy a new phone and restore from backup?

The Brazil Button?
