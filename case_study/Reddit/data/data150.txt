Comment 1: In theory one could store redundant passkeys with other services (1Password, Apple, etc.). And applications generally have some way to perform account recovery. If they donâ€™t it would be imperative to have backup authenticators.Comment 2: Probably yes :-(Comment 3: You mean if the passkeys are stored in your google account? Or do you mean what happens to the passkey which you use to log in at google. Which stored in your vault. When you delete that google account.Comment 4: Well, I would recommend you store a second set of passkeys somewhere other than a big account like Apple, Google of 1Password. Most sites will let you setup more than one passkey.

That's actually my biggest complaint with passkeys. There's no way for you to back them up anywhere. You can't export them from Apple's Keychain, or Chrome or 1Password.  That's a big risk. Any one of those accounts can get banned for whatever reason and you lose access to all your passkeys.

You never control your passkeys.  Someone else always does.Comment 5: That would depend on where you stored your passkeys. If you think there is a chance you will want to delete your Google account, then don't safe them in Google or Chrome.Comment 6: That's pretty scary.Comment 7: They seem to be tied to your Google or apple or whatever account. So if you lose access to your account, or they cut you off for whatever reason, are you screwed?Comment 8: Oh that. Good question. By the way since iOS 17 and Android 14 third party password managers can handle your passkeys. For instance 1Password, Bitwarden and Dashlane are capable of handling passkeys. Perhaps some others as well. But your question basically remains the same. What if you are locked out of your account? Then again the same applies with those complicated passwords nowadays.
