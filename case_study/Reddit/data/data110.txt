Comment 1: Seems to be missing a lot of the sites listed on [passkeys.directory](https://passkeys.directory)Comment 2: Ubiquiti does support 2FA, but not passkeysComment 3: AOD Federal Credit Union uses passkeys for passwordless logins on desktop browsers.Comment 4: Thanks for this website! Nice work!Comment 5: It's not obvious what the difference between the documents symbol and the refresh symbol in the details column is.Comment 6: This site ([https://passkeys.2fa.directory/](https://passkeys.2fa.directory/)) does not work with firefox, nothing is listed..Comment 7: As the two directories are separate, there will of course be instances where the directories differ.
This directory is however more than twice the size of passkeys.directory and as this one is maintained, the number of sites will continue to grow steadily.Comment 8: Thanks for your input! The refresh icon links to documentation on account recovery. Iâ€™ll see with the team if we can make that clearer in any way.Comment 9: Iâ€™ve had one other person tell me that and they ran Firefox ESR. Are you also using that or just an outdated version?
The reason seems to be that Firefox pre v120 has `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` turned off.Comment 10: Both directories are actively maintained - worth noting that passkeys.directory does not list sites that only support webauthn as mfa (not a passkey. Passkeys are for sign in.)

Also, passkeys.directory intentionally does not list sites where â€˜social sign inâ€™ is supported and the social service (sign in with Google for example) is where passkey support is.Comment 11: I'm not using the ESR version, I'm using 120.0.1 64bit on MacOS..  It says it is up-to-date.

I see you updated the site to point out the problem, which helps..

Edit: I checked the firefox release version, and 120.0.1 is the legit released version..  https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/Comment 12: Thatâ€™s very strange. The only reason I can think of is if you or an add-on has manually set `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` to __false__  in _about:config_.
Canâ€™t think of a reason why that would be done though.Comment 13: >The only reason I can think of is if you or an add-on has manually set

Default seems to be false for this version.  Future versions will have it true it if [https://caniuse.com/css-has](https://caniuse.com/css-has)can be trusted..Comment 14: Oh! I donâ€™t know how I could have missed that!
Sorry! ðŸ˜…
