Comment 1: They also allow disabling password login, which is great. However, even if you do that, there are still some places within myGov account settings that might ask for your password, so keep it in your password manager with your passkey.Comment 2: Make sure you backup a copy of your most recent Notice of Assessment (NoA) from the ATO website before you muck around with your myGov authentication settings. For some unknown reason, myGov wouldn't let me disable 2FA via the old Code Generator app and go passwordless until I unlinked ATO services first. I then nearly locked myself out of ATO services because I couldn't provide the reference number from my NoA as I didn't have already have a local copy readily available. Thankfully, I could still download it via the ATO app on my phone which was still logged in at the time.

The Medicare iOS app doesn't currently support myGovID or passkeys either yet, so make sure your credentials are cached before disabling your myGov password.Comment 3: Actually if you disable the password it flat out won't work anymore. I tried to log in to the Centrelink App, and the myGov sign in does not yet support sign in with passkey, and I've already disabled my password :-(Comment 4: Good adviceComment 5: That does not sound like a well-thought-through implementation.Comment 6: I’m not sure I understand the problem. If you go to Centrelink or myGov and login, then scroll down to the Sign in With Passkey button, it works just fine. Can you clarify where you encountered the problem?

Edit: I realised you meant within the Centrelink App, which I didn’t have. I just got it and tried it, and I got the same problem. Luckily, you can still go back to my.gov.au in a browser or through the myGov app, log in with your passkey and turn your password back on.Comment 7: Hardly surprising given the governmentComment 8: That option wasn’t working for me yesterday, kept giving me an error. Thankfully it works now! Turned password back on, defeating the whole point of a passkey in the first place.Comment 9: In 2FA deployments, there is a lot to consider, such as the user accidentally locking himself out, which is an obvious issue to address. Could you restore it?Comment 10: No it won’t let me lolComment 11: Oh no... I'm interested in how the recovery process will look with passkeys activated. You should be considered an MFA user now... so email flow should not be enough right?Comment 12: I have the MyGov Code Generator as well. The option to turn the password back on worked for me today. 

Ridiculous to release a feature (passkeys) and not have the main Apps (Centrelink, Medicare, ATO and Workforce) support it though!
