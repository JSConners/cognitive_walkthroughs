Comment 1: "Local" providers are typically going to work best because of the tighter integration of being the same company that built the rest of the platform. After that it's basically who you trust and how you like one platform over another. If you like and trust 3rd party password managers for keeping passkeys then that's what you should use.

Windows Hello is also a "local" provider but passkeys and FIDO credentials with Windows Hello are kept local on-device.Comment 2: Right now only a few third-party PW managers handle passkeys, and the ones that do are desktop-only (maybe with one or two exceptions), so the advantage is you can use it on mobile now instead of waiting. Ultimately it doesn't matter where they're stored because it's only the public key that is stored in whatever service. The private key is stored on the hardware device e.g. your phone.Comment 3: [deleted]Comment 4: This is soo cool. Maybe you guys can also manage to fix the auto fill issues that are in android with this new native appComment 5: So also the password managers store only the public key?Comment 6: NordPass's (fairly) new browser extension + browser app has terrific support for passkeys. No need for the desktop NordPass app. One of the nice things about NordPass's handling is that they identify passkeys as a record type, so it's easy to see how many passkeys you have and for which services.

I started out favoring local creation of passkeys, but doing it with NordPass is so easy and convenient that I'm thinking I'll just stick with that. (Bitwarden also does a pretty good job although right now I like NP better in this respect.)Comment 7: Yeah okComment 8: [deleted]Comment 9: [deleted]Comment 10: Yes but even if I don't use a password manager and save it on my phone then it's automatically synced with Google password manager or apple keychain which is also in cloud. So there is no differenceComment 11: Nord â‰  Norton. Which one do you hate?
