Comment 1: Thanks. It looks like a good overview touching a lot of important areas.


I'd like to nitpick or question one tiny piece

> Another alternative is to provide a recovery procedure per SMS, TOTP or some other thrusted means. Relying on solely a password as recovery is discouraged, since the recovery per password then becomes the "weakest link" of the authentication system.

~~Wouldn't SMS used for recovery likewise become the weakest link? (and arguably a lot weaker than a properly-selected password).~~  

* EDIT - nevermind. I gather you are suggesting that recovery should include password **plus** 2FA.  That makes more sense.
