Comment 1: Eventually you’d replace. There will be a transition period for back compat and possible incompatibilities. For  example my google account is using passkeys, but I still have a password.Comment 2: I wish everything use Passkey today.Comment 3: If possible I would delete passwords as a way to login. But only if passkeys are well implemented at that website and I have convince it works well.Comment 4: Yeah for now I'm keeping my passwords, but I guess someday if things go well for passkeys then there could be a period where they are deletedComment 5: Ya. It’ll take off later this year. Big ones are iOS 17 support, 1Password, and Microsoft full support. I like how google does it. It’s very clear what passkeys you have and what devices/apps.
I use 1password and will use that for most passkeys. However, I’ll probably not use it for the BIG accounts like google, apple, Microsoft. Little more work, but some things I want to keep separateComment 6: I use a Pixel 7 and Chrome on my Windows laptop.

On Chrome(Windows) it's clear what Passkeys you have, they are offline only though, I'm guessing that because of what you said about Microsoft? Will Passkeys ever go cloud based like promised on Chrome?

Also on Pixel 7 there is no UI to find Passkeys anywhere for me although they are there hidden and work. Are we waiting on Android 14 for that or is it just my device since I'm waiting on some slow rollout?
