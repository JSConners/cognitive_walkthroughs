Comment 1: This is by design. The passkey can't be set on device 2 if you're trying to sign in from device 1. You need to sign in with email and password on device 1 and then go through passkey set up again on device 1. However, this will mean the passkey is usable from both devices which is dangerous, so you should remove the passkey associated with device 2.Comment 2: I am having a similar issue, I signed out of my old phone, factory reset it, signed in on my new phone and my Google account passkey doesn't work, but passkeys for other accounts works perfectly fine.Comment 3: Exactly the same problem here. It's driving me crazy. It's definitely a problem with devices. I wish Google were more proactive in solving this mess. If you delete an account, a passkey, or anything else that I haven't yet figured out in a way that "it is frowned upon by Google," your device is toast.Comment 4: I understand you brother but I tried passkey.io through Bluetooth also and other Google accounts as the only passkey device and the same problem arises, I think the problem is not Google or the PC, I think it is something of me device for which I cannot find a solution, the device is a redmi note 12 pro 5g, Bluetooth works well with other devices but with the passkey it has not worked anywhere for me, not on Google, Twitter, passkey.io etc.  It may be that the Bluetooth on my PC when paired with my device is not completely compatible... I don't know...Comment 5: I also factory reset it, I thought it could be a device error, before the reset the passkey didn't work either and after it it didn't either.  It also does not work as a password for other accounts, which seems that at least for you it does, talking about the same device
