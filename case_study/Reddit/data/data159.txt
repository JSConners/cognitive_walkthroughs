Comment 1: Depends on what software you are using to manage your password/passkeys. For example, if you are using Apple devices, iCloud Keychain takes care of syncing passwords/passkeys across all your devices. I believe most password managers have the ability to sync across devices.

Don’t have any experience with Yubikey.Comment 2: You can copy a passkey by scanning a qr code from a device that has a passkey. Google and Apple both can sync passkeys using their built in password solutions and 3rd party password managers can sync as well.Comment 3: Your Yubikey is in itself a password. It’s a factor of authentication. Your passkey is a replacement for a yubikey but can’t be used with. They’re commonly confused as they can be referred to as hardware keysComment 4: And sometimes it lets me choose between different Samsung devices. But they don't use names like "Zfold4"  or Note20, but those impossible to remember numbers (SM-F936U)Comment 5: There two options : 
1) You scan a QR code after which the two devices exchange some cryptographic magic via Bluetooth and you are logged in at the other device. 
2) You store the passkey in a vault like iCloud Keychain, 1Password, Dashlane or Bitwarden. And the vault makes sure the passkey is available at the other device.Comment 6: To clarify u/ishboo3002’s first statement:

When creating or using a passkey, one option will be to use a different device via a QR code. That process simply offload the remaining passkey process to the other device; it **does not** copy the passkey to the original device.Comment 7: On my Windows laptop using Google Chrome, the Passkeys do not sync and are on device offline only.
I'm guessing this is coming soon? Is it Google or Microsoft we are waiting on? I know Windows 23H2 is supposed to have more Passkey support/features but I don't know if that just affects Edge or not or an OS thing.Comment 8: I know chrome is adding support. 1Password has it in beta and bitwarden says coming soon.
