Comment 1: For someone else reading this Passkeys require one of two things

To be setup on the device in the online setup of the passkey.  You may be able to setup a second passkey for each site depending on the specific site setup.

To be cloud stored and synced over to the device by setting up your password app on the device.  This is what I use.  With a family 1password account can share passkeys with multiple people.Comment 2: I got it to work. I wasn't completely sure how I did it, but this may have been the way.
