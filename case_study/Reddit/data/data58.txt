Comment 1: Like the article says. It needs to be a more convenient method for people to switch to it. Right now, the implementation of passkeys varies a lot. Some give you the option to begin with, some services ask for the passkey once you enter your e-mail/username, some use it as a 2FA only. Also the passkey has to get to the device you try to login as well. Those methods vary a lot, too. If I try to log in on a device I usually don't interact with, how would I do that?
