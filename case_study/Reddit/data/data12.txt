Comment 1: It's my understanding that when you add a Google account to an Android phone, a passkey is automatically created on that phone. If that's the case, then it makes sense that the button at the very top (create a passkey on this phone) would be grayed out. You can confirm this by going to the security tab in your Google account and seeing what passkeys exist. Does the button at the bottom work (add a passkey)? I think the bottom button is what you would use if you wanted to add a passkey to something like a Yubikey.Comment 2: u/grillmouster I'm kind of having a similar issue. At one point I could use my passkey on my android phone to sign into my Google account on my desktop instead of typing in a password. But yes I accidentally deleted my passkey from my Google account and now even though I have a passkey on my phone it doesn't allow me to use it to sign into my Google account on my desktop PC anymore . It doesn't nothing. It keeps giving me the error of something went wrong, try again or something else. 


Even when I tried to turn off/back on 2 step verification and even removed my Google account on my phone and add it back, my Google account still showed that I already had a passkey on my phone so I couldn't create another one. I wish there was a way I could create another passkey and share it to my Google account or reinstate my previous passkey on my Google account so I can sign in using my phone. I even tried to reach out to customer service and they sadly couldn't help me with this. 


I still can't use my phone passkey anymore to sign into my Google account on my desktop PC.Comment 3: I had to restart the phone after adding the account for the default key to appear....

I also had to clear the cache and storage for the Chrome app on Android to use the passkey! The prompts on the phone wouldn't do anything before that.Comment 4: Now I see the default passkey on Android, also there is a button to add more keys - it doesn't do anything!
