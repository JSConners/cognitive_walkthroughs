Comment 1: Passkeys mainly serve to reduce problems created by poorly crafted passwords (simple, too short) and bad security practices (kept in insecure places, accidentally told to scammers, etc). They don’t necessarily reduce the need (depending on context) for MFA, offline storage, physical access keys (yubikey), etc.

If the person you’re taking care of typically uses terrible (simple) passwords that are easy to brute-force or has a tendency to have lovely little chats with scammers, passkeys would be a major improvement. Just don’t think that passkeys allow you to forego other security practices like MFA, recovery codes, and storing essential passkeys (like for bank accounts) offline.Comment 2: Not from personal experience but I would imagine shared passkeys could help in caretaking.
