Comment 1: I would say so, but I doubt that threat model has been taken advantage of yet. Root means that anything has access - just as if any passwords were stored on the device.Comment 2: Good question. Afaik not better or worse than conventional passwords. Both are usually stored encrypted, but if the vault is broken into the attacker has both the password ans passkeys in it. Which is why some people advocate to keep the 2fa otp codes separate from the passwords.
