Comment 1: I still find it complicated. So I just made a Paypal passkey which is "synchronised"

I do not see it in my Google lists of passkeys.

When I find the passkey in my Paypall app (profile/ log in and security/passkey / manage) I read::

"You login to PayPal with this passkey. It's synched with your Android Devices"
And

"Created on:
Android PayPal app
Sep 8 2023"


So Paypal and others cannot use the Google passkey?
Any web provider will construct it's own passkey?
And where, if there is no app?Comment 2: >I do not see it in my Google lists of passkeys.

Do you mean you do not see in your Google Password Manager among the other credentials? If yes, is this on Android or another platform?Comment 3: I do not see Paypal  here: [https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/passkeys](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/passkeys)

Android.

Where I see all my Android devices and Apple. One m1 macbook and one Intel macmini.

AHA!.  But I see Paypal Passkey at Google Password Manager.

So there is where i had to look for them.

Great. I keep learning.

Thanks.Comment 4: Yes, the link that you pasted are only the passkeys for the "web service" [google.com](https://google.com) (so PayPal wouldn't be in here).

Google Password Manager that syncs your passkeys for all other web services, e.g. PayPal, is a different story.Comment 5: Here is where my know-how ends.  For a moment I thought the passkey is e.g. in your phone and can be used by any other company. Like a kind of yubikey.

But as I see it now the passkey is alwasy newly genereated by any company that wants to use it.Comment 6: I am still confused.

When I open Paypal in an  incognito web page. it asks me for a "normal" login with password  and after that I can choose for an SMS message, the paypal app or "Let us call you"

I choose the Paypal app, and that works fine. But no passkey option.
