Comment 1: Let's say Google decided to ban you for violating some rule  and locks your Google account. Will Passkeys still be accessible?Comment 2: I guess in theory if one still has access to the iPhone the Passkeys could still be used, and that passkey could be used to create a new one on another device tied to another account.Comment 3: Basically no. Passkeys are stored in your password manager. Well that’s the idea. So if you lose your iPhone, but still has access to your iPad with the same vault. You still have access to your accounts. The thing is that passkeys are relatively new. So you need to be certain in which vault they are stored. That doesn’t allways work as it is supposed to be.Comment 4: If your entire Google account is locked, then no — the passkeys won't be accessible.Comment 5: That is not what the question said. It specifically asked about keys stored in your Google account.
