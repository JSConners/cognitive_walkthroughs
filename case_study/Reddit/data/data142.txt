Comment 1: Even if the OS is “unlocked” the use of the passkey still requires the use of a biometric.Comment 2: I think you understand passkeys wrong. ( If I understand you correctly….) First of all you don’t explicitly need your biometrics. Like in the case of 1Password your password for 1Password is also sufficient. Passkeys itself have nothing to do with your biometrics. A passkey is a public- private key pair. In which the private key is synchronized among your devices using your password manager (iCloud Keychain, Dashlane, 1Password, Bitwarden) and the public key is send to the website when you register your Passkey. When you login a certificate is signed using your private key which can be verified using your public key. The biometrics or device pin code are just to verify if it’s you trying to login.Comment 3: It seems like the issue I'm encountering might be related to how password managers handle Passkeys. For instance, when I'm already logged in on my PC and 1Password is unlocked, visiting the Microsoft website and selecting "Sign in with Windows Hello or a security key" triggers a prompt from 1Password to "Sign in with a passkey". Clicking on this option grants immediate access, and there is no biometric authentication required at the point of selecting the account for "Sign in with a passkey".  
  
Is it the case that other services that store a passkey handle this differently? Do they require re-authentication at the moment the passkey is used for signing in?Comment 4: Ah, I guess one could also use the password used to unlock the device, as well, if they know it. But if someone sharing a login to a device that manages passkeys also has the password/passcode to unlock that device, they could use the Passkeys, as well.Comment 5: Ah, yeah. I haven’t use 1Password’s implementation but I could see that.

In my experience In iOS/iPadOS and macOS one has to do TouchID/FaceID or use the unlock passcode/password each time before using a passkey.
