Comment 1: emphasis on **Total Mess** - I would never subject my current Passkey experience to the rest of my family and friends (even those who are technically proficient) - don’t get me wrong, I’m happy the transition is happening but clearly there is no standardization for implementation (as clearly evidenced by eBay) and the fact that it can be so ambiguous where your key is stored, my dad has a hard enough time juggling passwords in a single password manager - the way Passkeys are managed now would be a total nightmare.  What seems to be the most consistent experience is registering my Yubikey as a 2FA device on each site that supports it - there is nothing “magic” about it - I go to my Security Settings of a particular site and it lists valid keys.  Passkeys seems a bit more hocus pocus and working towards the direction of being “seamless” but as the article states, we ain’t there yet!  I so can’t wait for all this to be ironed out in the next few years… (am I being too optimistic?)Comment 2: I set up passkeys on all my accounts that offer it (stored in one vault) as an option even if it is a dumpster fire when it's not at least kind of a similar process across services. I think the misunderstanding is that passkeys *will* replace passwords, and not that they *are* currently. Completely shedding passwords technologically, and all the behavior that's been trained into people around passwords, will take several years.Comment 3: > I put passkeys everywhere I can even if it is kind of a dumpster fire

Do you mean you active passkeys everywhere you can or you have multiple passkeys for the same service in different passkey wallets?Comment 4: >Do you mean you active passkeys everywhere you can

This. Edited original to be clearer.
