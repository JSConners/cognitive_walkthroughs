Comment 1: I have passkeys stored elsewhere so you’re probably doing something wrong somewhere.Comment 2: yes i store my other passkeys in 1password as well, but not for Apple account’s passkey. I don’t even know when it was generated. Normally there would be a popup from 1password extension when a site ask for passkey login, but it’s not the case for apple websiteComment 3: Apple does not support registering passkeys for Apple IDs except for the passkeys that are automatically registered for qualified Apple devices after signing in. I suppose these passkeys don't have any special properties, they are just the only ones Apple allows registering.
