Comment 1: I recommend one of [these](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyUD8uN) that I use for my keyComment 2: Have you had any issues registering your Titan key at any websites?

Also, do you know of a way to view the FIDO2 resident credentials that are stored inside the key?Comment 3: *re:  view the FIDO2 resident credentials that are stored inside the key?*

I understand that it is *not* possible due to the version of CTAP that is implemented on this key.

On Chrome browser's manage security keys, you see this message: "Enter the PIN for your security key. If you don’t know the PIN, you’ll need to reset the security key"  I think it's part of the CTAP2 protocol
