"The core idea is passkeys is public key cryptography. When you create a passkeys for a website,your device is generating a key pair where you keep the private key and the website stores the public key. These key pairs are just small text files. Syncing, importing, and exporting Is absolutely possible and there is no blocker from the protocol implementation there. I do agree vendors need to make it so their software can export and import passkeys, but this is not a problem of passkeys themselves. It's vendors attempting to do vendor lock-in and is not exclusive to passkeys. If you want to, you can use different password managers with passkeys and seamesly sync your passkeys across devices.

"When you do need to use a passkey from your phone to sign in on another device, the first step is  usually to scan a QR code displayed by that device. The device then verifies that your phone is in  proximity using a small anonymous Bluetooth message and sets up an end-to-end encrypted  connection to the phone through the internet. The phone uses this connection to deliver your one-time  passkey signature, which requires your approval and the biometric or screen lock step on the phone.",strong security,#5550ff,Trust and Security,Tags,security_googleblog_com_2023_05_so-long-passwords-thanks-for-all-phish_html,,,,,,Google Search = Passkeys,,2024-09-30 12:10,https://fido2-research-mwww.dovetail.com/data/42eCumCQv8CQL0N3jXOF4Q#:v:h=4iJeOP2FrvW39nImdIjZyQ

These are device bound passkeys. You can’t export them. So you will lose them if you reinstall. This is by design. What you want is syncable passkeys such as those done by iOS and android natively. That isn’t available on windows yet. For any accounts where you have a passkey I suggest configuring another if possible on another device so you have a backup method to logon. If this is not possible you will need to reconfigure replacement passkeys after reinstalling windows. This also assumes all accounts with passkeys are accessible via other methods . Else an account recovery process may need to be invoked potentially.,Recovery from loss,#dc3cbc,Recovery from loss,Tags,"about to reinstall windows, but scared to lose passkeys",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1bjf7lx/about_to_reinstall_windows_but_scared_to_lose/,,,,Reddit -- done,,2024-08-16 09:02,https://fido2-research-mwww.dovetail.com/data/46vENQ6DcjKEzhbfUP2GwG#:v:h=FRMYDQp42NuqecO2NzEYk

"*Strictly when it comes to the topic of recovery plans for passkey protected accounts*, there really isn't a huge diff between password auth and passkeys.  A passkey can be made just as tangible as a password, and can be kept pretty safe, as long as it's always held securely. For example, you can create a few additional passkeys and enroll them as additional passkeys in every one of your passkey protected accounts.  If these passkeys are held in one or more physical security keys, the physical security keys can be put in a safe or safety deposit box.  The same types of instructions you mention that could be left with passwords, could be created for how to use these passkeys.  The instructions could include websites and the PIN numbers for each physical security key.  If someone somehow got access to just your safety deposit box, they would have no practical way to access the private keys on the physical security keys.  If they got access to just your instructions, they'd need to get access to your safety deposit box in order to access your accounts.",Recovery from loss - Backups,#8cb41e,Recovery from loss,Tags,Passkeys: what happens after you've died or been incapacitated?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/17d6kg2/passkeys_what_happens_after_youve_died_or_been/,,,,Reddit -- done,,2024-11-06 16:16,https://fido2-research-mwww.dovetail.com/data/5DQMTNwNqS77eZvgTdaHnS#:v:h=UOhT4Ye2lxoDLfIseT1wT

There was a little issue with at first but once I got the issue worked out it was smooth sailing. But then I got this year a Samsung Galaxy s24+ and most recently whenever I try to log into my Google account on the desktop and use my phone as a passkey it doesn't work. Google just give me the error "" we weren't able to sign you in. Try again or try another way."" Then after I do get in using my old password and I try to create another or new passkey then I get this error under the create a passkey part: ""let's save a passkey on this device to sign in to ""google.com"" as my personal@gmail.com. this request comes from the app ""brave.exe"" by Brave software inc."" then it's prompting me for a pin but I don't have a pin for brave browser on my desktop. And I don't want to save a passkey to my PC. I want to use my phone as a passkey to sign into my Google account.  Then whenever I select the other option ""use another device"" under the create a passkey it wants me to ""insert your security key into the USB port"" which I don't have.

"Comment 13: Hi there, It sounds like you're experiencing some frustrating issues with on-device encryption and passkey storage on Android. The error message you're seeing suggests that the encrypted data is tied to a specific device state and may require recent authentication on a device linked to your Google account. Possible Solutions: 1. Recent Device Authentication:    - Ensure you have recently logged into your Google account on the device in question. Sometimes a fresh login can reset the encryption status.    - Try accessing the data on a device where you have recently signed in to your Google account. 2. Check for Software Updates:    - Make sure your Android device is running the latest version of the software. Updates often include bug fixes that can resolve such issues. 3. Clear Cache and Data:    - Go to Settings > Apps > \[App Name\] (the one you're using for passkeys) > Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data. This can sometimes help reset the encryption handling. 4. Reboot in Safe Mode:    - Restart your device in Safe Mode (usually by holding the power button and then tapping and holding 'Power off' until the 'Safe Mode' option appears). This can help determine if a third-party app is interfering with the encryption. 5. Use Alternative Security Solutions:    - If the built-in options are not meeting your needs, consider using dedicated security and encryption apps. For example, apps like Signal offer robust encryption for messages and calls, while password managers like Bitwarden provide secure passkey storage. A Note on Secure Devices: If you find these solutions cumbersome and are looking for a more straightforward approach to maintaining security and privacy on your device, you might be interested in devices specifically designed for enhanced security, such as the StellarProtect phone. It offers built-in, always-on encryption and a host of other features designed to keep your data secure without the hassle of constant troubleshooting. Hopefully, one of these suggestions helps resolve your issue. If not, it might be worth exploring dedicated secure devices for a more seamless experience.

" Hi there, It sounds like you're experiencing some frustrating issues with on-device encryption and passkey storage on Android. The error message you're seeing suggests that the encrypted data is tied to a specific device state and may require recent authentication on a device linked to your Google account. Possible Solutions: 1. Recent Device Authentication:    - Ensure you have recently logged into your Google account on the device in question. Sometimes a fresh login can reset the encryption status.    - Try accessing the data on a device where you have recently signed in to your Google account. 2. Check for Software Updates:    - Make sure your Android device is running the latest version of the software. Updates often include bug fixes that can resolve such issues. 3. Clear Cache and Data:    - Go to Settings > Apps > \[App Name\] (the one you're using for passkeys) > Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data. This can sometimes help reset the encryption handling. 4. Reboot in Safe Mode:    - Restart your device in Safe Mode (usually by holding the power button and then tapping and holding 'Power off' until the 'Safe Mode' option appears). This can help determine if a third-party app is interfering with the encryption. 5. Use Alternative Security Solutions:    - If the built-in options are not meeting your needs, consider using dedicated security and encryption apps. For example, apps like Signal offer robust encryption for messages and calls, while password managers like Bitwarden provide secure passkey storage. A Note on Secure Devices: If you find these solutions cumbersome and are looking for a more straightforward approach to maintaining security and privacy on your device, you might be interested in devices specifically designed for enhanced security, such as the StellarProtect phone. It offers built-in, always-on encryption and a host of other features designed to keep your data secure without the hassle of constant troubleshooting. Hopefully, one of these suggestions helps resolve your issue. If not, it might be worth exploring dedicated secure devices for a more seamless experience.

"thanks, it seems like w the advent of passkeys it would make sense to begin eliminating less secure forms of 2fa, since pk are more or less used as a form of 2fa with most accounts theyre available on. that part makes it seem like pk would have already proven one purpose (to get rid of less secure 2fa), but that hasnt really happened, seems to me anyway. why force me to keep a numher for verification purposes (as well as an email) when a pk is avaulable to use in its place? amazon doesnt require a phone number, but it does still req an email and password + totp. ms, no pw anymore but must keep  email and or a phone number, and i dont think u can choose pk to login w. is this just cuz each company chooses to implement them differently? they shouldnt be wary of letting users who want it have the option to only use pk as login or as 2fa (and bye to sms for ex). i get that its new and costly to imppement tho hence mixed bags re implelementation.",MFA Confusion,#00b4c8,Mental Modeling,Tags,whats the (future) point of passkeys?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1caxek4/whats_the_future_point_of_passkeys/,,,,Reddit -- done,,2024-07-25 18:36,https://fido2-research-mwww.dovetail.com/data/65KkHHzTbmjbNGRqZWuA1D#:v:h=3Bx9mCI4WbspZLo0vkCFlo

"My advice at this point is to just wait a bit before jumping on the passkeys  bandwagon. They have the potential to replace passwords and 2FA, but we need to  figure out a workable cross-platform solution to the account recovery and multi-  device problems. Existing password managers like 1Password and Bitwarden are  already working on this. When those become available, they’ll need some time to  shake out any problems, so I wouldn’t rely on them solely. That is, keep using strong  passwords and 2FA for your online accounts, at least as a backup. Maybe some day  we’ll have a single, open spec for this.

"I have been considering rolling out passkeys as the primary authentication method for my company’s IDP (Google workspace). I have several concerns: 1. Passkeys cannot be centrally managed: While it is very convenient for employees to generate and use passkeys, it is actually TOO convenient for employees to generate and use them. Employees could generate passkeys on their personal (non-work) devices that are not managed by the company and often don’t have protection/prevention mechanisms such as MDMs or EDR.  2. Is it really two factor?: Is it two factor if you’re using the same device to login to your account? What’s the first and second factor in this case? 3. Compatibility with Linux: It doesn’t look like this issue will be resolved anytime soon.  General question: Is there a real security benefit for using on device passkeys over passwords + physical FIDO keys (yubikeys), apart from ease of use?",Enterprise Systems,#dc3cbc,UX,Tags,Are passkeys enterprise ready?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passkeys/comments/1bvwoe0/are_passkeys_enterprise_ready/,,,,Reddit -- done,,2024-07-25 19:02,https://fido2-research-mwww.dovetail.com/data/7BwwGZ85LPjErjsVNgBQlB#:v:h=2e2c0bECF42gpCUmN62fln
