# Cognitive Walkthroughs

This is repository contains the cognitive walkthrough and screenshots from the websites navigated.

The cognitive walkthrough was performed by *Redacted* and *Redcated* from the *Redacted lab* at *Redacted University*.

## Methodology

We performed the following actions:

1. Log into an existing account and add a passkey.
2. Create a new account.

> In depth steps for each of the above actions can be viewed in the directory for each website. 

Through the process of each step, the researchers moved through the process step-by-step, discussing potential failures and successes, and adding redesign notes as needed.

> *Note*: Failures and successes were added if concensus was reached by the researchers.
