# Cognitive walkthrough session notes 

## Notes
We are going to do videos for Gmail, using all combinations. 
For all other websites, we are just going to do a single video. 

## TODO Next time
 1. Go through the videos and fix up other walkthroughs
 2. Comparing the differences between each combination in Gmail.
 3. What is actually being sent via bluetooth? 

## Organizing the paper
### Cognitive Walkthrough Section
 1. Methodology, results with a narrative

### Media articles about passkeys 
 RQ1. How are companies that are backing passkeys presenting Passkeys to users? 
 RQ2. How is the media presenting pros/cons to it's readers?
 RQ3. What advice are companies and the media giving users? 
 RQ4. What are the misconceptions about Passkeys? 

 Paper Sections -- 
 1. Methodology (in the google doc)
 2. Thematic analysis, done with MaxQDA (what do they do well, what do they misunderstand, what do they do poorly). 


# UBER SUPER IMPORTANT -- 
We need to be clear in the paper, that we performed this walkthrough on X date, at approximately X time, and have screen capture recordings, as dialogue may change.
