### Setting up a Passkey with Existing Account

| Step | Success and Failure | Design Suggestions or Comments |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Go into account settings, click "Hardware Security Device." | Failure: This is under multi-factor security and does not tell the user until later in the process they can use it to login. <br><br> Failure: the phrase "Passkey" does not appear until the OS level notification. | Use common phrasing such as the word "Passkey". Notify the user BEFORE creation that it can be used to login to the account. |
